    <English>[TAB]St. Peter's Basilica, located in Vatican City, Italy, is the home of the Pope and the heart of the Catholic Church. Having only been occupied by the Pope since the breakup of the Papal State in 1871, the current St. Peter's Basilica is a relatively new addition to the Church's assets. Sitting adjacent to the iconic St. Peter's Square, the Palace acts as the administrative center for all business of the Catholic Church. Further, it is from here that the Pope issues decrees which affect Catholics throughout the world. And with nearly one in six people on Earth prescribing to Catholicism, this means the St. Peter's Basilica is the headquarters for one of the most influential organizations on the planet.[PARAGRAPH:2]While the palace's importance as a world administrative center cannot be doubted, the St. Peter's Basilica also houses one of the most famous art collections on Earth. Contained within the walls of the St. Peter's Basilica is the Vatican Museum, which displays the works of master artisans Caravaggio, Raphael and Da Vinci. Michelangelo's famous Sistine Chapel is also a part of the St. Peter's Basilica.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Hagia Sophia, or "Church of the Holy Wisdom," was constructed in 530 AD as a Greek Orthodox church. Standing in Istanbul (originally Constantinople), Turkey, it is a beautiful and ornate structure, built of stone and marble, and topped by a golden dome measuring over 100 feet in diameter. An extremely difficult engineering challenge for the time, the dome has collapsed several times during its existence. Four graceful towers stand at the corners of the building.[PARAGRAPH:2]The interior of the Hagia Sophia is a marvelous space of columns and arches extending up to the dome, which appears almost to float atop the building. The interior was sheathed in colored marble and golden mosaics depicting biblical scenes and images of Christian saints.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1453 Constantinople was captured by the Ottoman Turks, and the Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque. Human images are not welcome in mosques, and many of the mosaics were covered with plaster.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1934, Turkish President Kemal Ataturk turned the building into a museum. In recent years some restoration work has been done on the Hagia Sophia, and a few of the mosaics have been uncovered. Despite the ravages of time, the Hagia Sophia remains universally acknowledged as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (it was formerly the Basilica of Saint John the Baptist), is located in the old city of Damascus, and is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. It is considered the fourth-holiest place in Islam.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Arab conquest of Damascus in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica, which was dedicated to John the Baptist (Yahya) since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine I. The mosque holds a shrine which today may still contain the head of John the Baptist, honored as a prophet by both Christians and Muslims alike. There are also many important landmarks within the mosque for the Shi'ah, among them the place where the head of Husayn (the grandson of Muhammad) was kept on display by Yazid I. The tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]Damascus was captured and besieged by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. Decades later, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I, then commissioned the construction of a mosque on the site of the Byzantine cathedral in 706. Prior to this, the cathedral was still in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims had been constructed on the southeastern part of the building. Al-Walid, who personally supervised the project, had most of the cathedral including the musalla demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building. The new house of worship was meant to serve as a large congregational mosque for the citizens of Damascus and as a tribute to the city. Because of Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered the all other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 715 by the caliph, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, shortly after the death of al-Walid that same year.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 dinars were spent on the project. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the work force which consisted of 12,000 people. Ibn al-Faqih also relays the story that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of St. John the Baptist, or Yahya ibn Zakariya in Islam. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.</English>

Due to its importance for Judaism and Islam it is one of the most contested religious sites in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Temple Mount contains the holiest site in Judaism. Jewish Midrash holds that it was from here that the world expanded into its present form, and that this was where God gathered the dust he used to create the first man, Adam. The Torah records that it was here that God chose to rest His Name and Divine Presence, and consequently two Jewish Temples were built at the site. According to Jewish tradition, the Third Temple will also be located here, and will be the final one. In recent times, due to difficulties in ascertaining the precise location of the Mount's holiest spot, many Jews will not set foot on the Mount itself.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Noble Sanctuary is the third holiest site in Islam, revered as the destination of Muhammad's journey to Jerusalem, and the location of his ascent to heaven. The site is also associated with all the Jewish biblical prophets who are also revered in Islam. The site is the location of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, the oldest extant Islamic structure in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Controlled by Israel since 1967, both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim sovereignty over the site, which remains a key issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. A Muslim council, known as the Muslim Waqf, manages the site. The Israeli government enforces a controversial ban on prayer by non-Muslim visitors.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Kazimierz is a historical district of Krakw (Poland), best known for being home to a Jewish community from the 14th century until the Second World War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jews had played an important role in the Krakw region economy since the end thirteenth century. The Jewish community in Krakw had lived undisturbed alongside their Christian neighbours under the protective King Kazimierz III. By the reign of King Jogaila (reigned in Poland 1386-1434), however, relations had deteriorated and pogroms began to occur with increasing frequency. As part of the re-founding of the Cracow Academy, starting in 1400, the Academy began to buy out buildings in the old Jewish district. The Jewish community moved to the area around modern Plac Szczepanski. During the last decade of the fifteenth century anti-Semitism led many Jews to move out of Krakw to nearby Kazimierz. There, they built a Fortress synagogue, the Old Synagogue (Krakw). In 1494 a disastrous fire destroyed a large part of Krakw. Raging populace soon attacked the Jews, blaming the fire on them. In 1495 the Polish king John I Albert of Poland expelled all Jews from Krakw, resettling them to the old Bawl district of Kazimierz. For its own defence against Christian raids, the kahal petitioned the Kazimierz town council for the right to build its own interior wall, cutting across the western end of the older defensive walls in 1553. Due to the growth of the community, the walls were expanded again in 1608. Later requests to expand the walls were turned down.[PARAGRAPH:2]The area between the walls was known as the Oppidum Judaeorum, the Jewish City, which represented only about one fifth of the geographical area of Kazimierz, but nearly half of its inhabitants. The Oppidum became the main spiritual and cultural centre of Polish Jewry, hosting many of Poland's finest Jewish scholars, artists and craftsmen. Among its famous inhabitants were the Talmudist Moses Isserles, the Kabbalist Natan Szpiro, and the royal physician Shmuel bar Meshulam.[PARAGRAPH:2]Interior of the Old Synagogue of Kazimierz before 1939.The golden age of the Oppidum came to an end in 1782, when the Austrian Emperor Joseph II disbanded the kahal. In 1822, the walls were torn down, removing any physical reminder of the old borders between Jewish and Christian Kazimierz.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1791, Kazimierz lost its status as a separate city and became a district of Krakw. The richer Jewish families quickly moved out of the overcrowded streets of eastern Kazimierz. Because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath, however, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues in the old Oppidum, maintaining Kazimierz's reputation as a "Jewish district" long after the concept ceased to have any administrative meaning. By the 1930s, Krakw had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses scattered across the city and much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podgrze.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jewish children in front of Corpus Christi church sometime before 1939.In a tourist guide published in 1935, Meir Balaban, a Reform rabbi and professor of History at the University of Warsaw, lamented that the Jews who remained in the once vibrant Oppidum were "only the poor and the ultra-conservative." However, this same exodus was the reason why most of the buildings in the Oppidum are preserved today in something close to their 18th century shape.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the Second World War, the Jews of Krakow, including those in Kazimierz, were forced by the Nazis into a crowded ghetto in Podgrze, across the river. Most of them were later killed during the liquidation of the ghetto or in death camps.</English>

    <English>[TAB]El Escorial is a historical residence of the king of Spain. It is one of the Spanish royal sites and functions as a monastery, royal palace, museum, and school. It is located about 45 kilometres (28 miles) northwest of the Spanish capital, Madrid, in the town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. El Escorial comprises two architectural complexes of great historical and cultural significance: El Real Monasterio de El Escorial itself and La Granjilla de La Fresneda, a royal hunting lodge and monastic retreat about five kilometres away. These sites have a dual nature; that is to say, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they were places in which the temporal power of the Spanish monarchy and the ecclesiastical predominance of the Roman Catholic religion in Spain found a common architectural manifestation. El Escorial was, at once, a monastery and a Spanish royal palace. Originally a property of the Hieronymite monks, it is now an monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip II of Spain, reacting to the Protestant Reformation sweeping through Europe during the sixteenth century, devoted much of his lengthy reign (1556-1598) and much of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of New World gold to stemming the Protestant tide. His protracted efforts were, in the long run, partly successful. However, the same counter-reformational impulse had a much more benign expression, thirty years earlier, in Philip's decision to build the complex at El Escorial.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip engaged the Spanish architect, Juan Bautista de Toledo, to be his collaborator in the design of El Escorial. Juan Bautista had spent the greater part of his career in Rome, where he had worked on the basilica of St. Peter's, and in Naples, where he had served the king's viceroy, whose recommendation brought him to the king's attention. Philip appointed him architect-royal in 1559, and together they designed El Escorial as a monument to Spain's role as a center of the Christian world.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Krak des Chevaliers ("fortress of the knights" in a mixture of Arabic and French) was the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller in Syria during the Crusades. The castle is located east of Tripoli in the Homs Gap, atop a 650-meter high hill along the only route from Antioch to Beirut and the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of many fortresses part of a defensive network along the border of the old Crusader states.[PARAGRAPH:2]The original fortress had been built in 1031 for the emir of Aleppo. It was captured by Raymond IV of Toulouse early in 1099, during the First Crusade, but was abandoned when the Crusaders continued their march to Jerusalem. It was reoccupied again by Tancred, Prince of Galilee, in 1110. Raymond II, count of Tripoli, gave it to the Hospitallers in 1144. The Hospitallers rebuilt it and expanded it into the largest Crusader fortress in the Holy Land, adding an outer wall 3 meters thick with seven guard towers 8-10 meters thick, to create a concentric castle. One of these towers was occupied by the Grand Master of the Hospitallers. In the 12th century there was a moat covered by a drawbridge leading to postern gates.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1163, the fortress was unsuccessfully besieged by Nur ad-Din. After their victory the Hospitallers became an essentially independent force on the Tripolitanian frontier. By 1170, the Hospitallers' modifications were complete, but parts of the fortress were rebuilt after numerous earthquakes in the late 12th century and early 13th century. It is estimated that the castle fortress could hold 50-60 Hospitallers and up to 2,000 foot soldiers. Aside from the control of the road to the Mediterranean, the Hospitallers also exerted some influence over Lake Homs to the east, where they could control the fishing industry and watch for Muslim armies gathering in Syria.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another failed siege was made by Saladin in 1188, during which the castle general was captured. He was taken by Saladin's men to the castle gates where he was told to order the gates opened. He first told his men in Arabic to surrender the castle, then in French told them to hold the castle to the last man. (Adapted from Wikipedia.org)</English>

The former is thought to best preserve the style of the medieval garden in Al-Andalus. Originally the palace was linked to the Alhambra by a covered walkway across the ravine that now divides them. The Generalife is one of the oldest surviving Moorish gardens.[PARAGRAPH:2]The present-day gardens were started in 1931 and completed by Francisco Prieto Moreno in 1951.

The cult site is sparsely documented, but it is referenced in the Norse sagas and Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum, and most notably as a gilded temple in the work of Adam of Bremen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Adam of Bremen wrote that the Swedes had a famous temple named Ubsola near which there was a large tree with wide branches. It was always green, and no one knew what species it was. There was also a well where they apparently used to perform the sacrifices. One of these was to immerse a living man in the well. If the man disappeared the gods would answer the prayers. It was not far from the towns of Sigtuna and Birka.[PARAGRAPH:2]A golden chain was around the temple hanging over its gables. The chain could be seen glittering far and wide for those who approached. It stood on flat ground surrounded by mounds like a theatre. Inside the temple, which was richly decorated with gold, there were three statues of gods. The most important god, Thor sat on a throne in the centre and beside him sat the gods Odin (called Wotan by Adam) and Freyr (called Fricco by Adam). Thor was said to govern the air, thunder, lightning, winds, rain, good weather and harvests. Odin, which meant the furious, brought war and gave strength against enemies. Freyr who gave peace and pleasure was represented by a statue with an immense phallos. Odin's statue was armed, and was likened to Mars and Thor was likened by Adam to Jupiter. The people also worshiped heroes who had been elevated to gods, such as King Erik about whom it is told in Vita Ansgari.[PARAGRAPH:2]There were priests appointed for the gods, and if plague or famine threatened they sacrificed to Thor, whereas they sacrificed to Odin for war and to Freyr for marriages.</English>

It was promoted to a capital city by Simeon I (893-927), who moved the capital here from Pliska and within a short time the town became established as an administrative, religious and cultural centre of the medieval Bulgarian state, renowned for its remarkable monumental construction, by the achievements of the applied arts, stone sculpture, painted pottery, by its literary school. Sexagon by Yoan Exarch describes the exceptional brilliance and magnificence of the royal capital. As a capital of the Bulgarian Kingdom from 893 until 969, the town has been directly associated with the unprecedented upsurge and flowering of culture and literature during the period, known as a Golden Age of Bulgarian Culture.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Round (Golden) Church (10th century) is characterized by an original artistic design and exquisite plastic decorations. It consists of a rotund, a narthex and an atrium. The rotund was covered by a semispherical gilt-plated dome, whereby its shape was additionally emphasized by 12 lean columns, surrounding it in a circle. Rising in the centre of the rotund was a marble pulpit. There used to be a wall in the centre of the atrium. The pieces of marble columns, capitals with stylized acanthus, parts of cornices, fine columns encrusted with multicoloured slabs, ceramic slabs, etc. come to show that the church had had an exclusively rich architectural decoration. The walls of the church had been faced to a certain height by marble, followed by wall mosaics of glass, stone, ceramic and guilt cubes. Remains of structures of different assignments were also uncovered during the excavations of the old Preslav: dwellings, workshops, ateliers, baths, as well as a water pipe system.</English>

He is noted for his military prowess, commanding the forces of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and those of his immediate successors of the Rashidun Caliphate; Abu Bakr and Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab). It was under his military leadership that Arabia, for the first time in history, was united under a single political entity, the Caliphate. He has the distinction of being undefeated in over a hundred battles, against the numerically superior forces of the Byzantine Roman Empire, Sassanid Persian Empire, and their allies, in addition to other Arab tribes. His strategic achievements include the conquest of Arabia, Persian Mesopotamia and Roman Syria within several years from 633 to 636. He is also remembered for his decisive victories at Yamamah, Ullais, Firaz, and his tactical marvels, Walaja and Yarmouk.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khaled ibn Walid was from the Meccan tribe of Quraysh, who initially opposed Muhammad. He played a vital role in Qurayshi victory at the Battle of Uhud. He converted to Islam, however, and joined Muhammad after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and participated in various expeditions for him, such as the Battle of Mu'tah. After Muhammad's death, he played a key role in commanding Medinan forces for Abu Bakr in the Ridda wars, the capture of the Sassanid Arab client Kingdom of Al-Hirah, and the defeat of the Sassanid Persian forces during his conquest of Iraq. He then crossed the desert to capture the Byzantine Arab client state of the Ghassanids during his conquest of Roman Syria. Even though Umar later relieved him of high command, he remained the effective leader of the forces arrayed against the Byzantines during the early stages of the Byzantine-Arab Wars. Under his command, Damascus was captured in 634 and the key Arab victory against the Roman Byzantine forces was achieved at the Battle of Yarmouk (636), which led to the conquest of the Bilad al-Sham (Levant).[PARAGRAPH:2]Khalid died and was buried in 642 in Emesa (Hims), Syria. His tomb is now part of a mosque called Jamia Khalid ibn al-Walid (Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque).

It was written in Latin and is known by its Latin name. The usual English translation of Magna Carta is Great Charter.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta required King John of England to proclaim certain rights (pertaining to freemen), respect certain legal procedures, and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects, whether free or fettered - and implicitly supported what became the writ of habeas corpus, allowing appeal against unlawful imprisonment.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta was arguably the most significant early influence on the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law today in the English speaking world. Magna Carta influenced the development of the common law and many constitutional documents, including the United States Constitution. Many clauses were renewed throughout the Middle Ages, and continued to be renewed as late as the 18th century. By the second half of the 19th century, however, most clauses in their original form had been repealed from English law.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta was the first document forced onto an English King by a group of his subjects (the barons) in an attempt to limit his powers by law and protect their privileges. It was preceded by the 1100 Charter of Liberties in which King Henry I voluntarily stated that his own powers were under the law.[PARAGRAPH:2]In practice, Magna Carta in the medieval period mostly did not limit the power of Kings; but by the time of the English Civil War it had become an important symbol for those who wished to show that the King was bound by the law.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta is normally understood to refer to a single document, that of 1215. Various amended versions of Magna Carta appeared in subsequent years however, and it is the 1297 version which remains on the statute books of England and Wales.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Golden Bull of 1222 was a golden bull, or edict, issued by King Andrew II of Hungary. The law established the rights of Hungary's noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (jus resistendi). The nobles and the church were freed from all taxes and could not be forced to go to war outside of Hungary and were not obligated to finance it. This was also a historically important document because it set down the principles of equality for all of the nation's nobility. Seven copies of the edict were created, one for each of the following institutions: to the Pope, to the Knights Templar, to the Knights Hospitaller, to the Hungarian king itself, to the chapters of Esztergom and Kalocsa and to the palatine.[PARAGRAPH:2]The charter's creation was influenced by the emergence of a nobility middle class, unusual in the nation's feudal system. As a regular gesture of generosity, King Andrew often donated property to particularly faithful servants, who thereafter gained new economic and class power. With the nation's class system and economic state changing, King Andrew found himself coerced into decreeing the Golden Bull of 1222 to calm the waters between hereditary nobles and the budding middle class nobility.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Golden Bull is often compared to the Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while the Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England.</English>

    <Chinese>[注]1222年的金牛是匈牙利国王安德鲁二世颁布的一项金牛法令。该法确立了匈牙利贵族的权利，包括在国王违反法律时不服从国王的权利（jus resistndi）。贵族和教会免除了一切税收，不能被迫在匈牙利境外开战，也没有义务为其提供资金。这也是一份历史性的重要文件，因为它规定了国家所有贵族平等的原则。这项法令共有七份，每一份都适用于以下机构：教皇、圣殿骑士、霍普利特骑士、匈牙利国王、埃斯泽特格姆和卡洛萨以及帕拉廷，在这个国家的封建制度中是不寻常的。作为一种经常的慷慨姿态，安德鲁国王经常把财产捐给特别忠诚的仆人，这些仆人后来获得了新的经济和阶级权力。随着国家阶级制度和经济状况的变化，安德鲁国王发现自己被迫颁布了1222年的金牛勋章，以平息世袭贵族和新兴中产阶级贵族之间的隔阂；公牛是匈牙利国家的第一份宪法文件，而大宪章是英国国家的第一份宪法宪章。</Chinese>

    <English>[TAB]The Alhambra is a palace and fortress complex of the Moorish monarchs of Granada, in southern Spain (known as Al-Andalus when the fortress was constructed), occupying a hilly terrace on the south-eastern border of the city of Granada. It was the residence of the Muslim kings of Granada and their court, but is currently a museum exhibiting exquisite Islamic architecture. A Renaissance palace was also inserted by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.[PARAGRAPH:2]The name Alhambra, signifying in Arabic the red, derives from the colour of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings now seen today are reddish. The first reference to the Qal'at al Hamra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies during the rule of the Abdallah (who reigned from 888-912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, nowadays located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small and its walls were not capable of deterring army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghralla, vizier to the King Badis of the Zirid Dynasty, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the Sabikah hill. However, evidence from Arab texts indicates that the fortress was easily penetrated and that the actual Alhambra that survives today was built during the Nasrid Dynasty. -Wikipedia</English>

It is very often mistaken for the Church of the Savior on Blood, located in St. Petersburg. In the West, it is frequently confused with the Kremlin which overlooks it. Arguably the most recognized building in Russia, it is an international symbol for the nation and for the city of Moscow.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cathedral was commissioned by Ivan IV in Moscow to commemorate the capture of the Khanate of Kazan, and built from 1555 to 1561. In 1588 Tsar Fedor Ivanovich had a chapel added on the eastern side above the grave of Basil Fool for Christ, a Russian Orthodox saint after whom the cathedral was popularly named.[PARAGRAPH:2]Saint Basil's is located at the southeast end of Red Square, just across from the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin. Not particularly large, it consists of nine chapels built on a single foundation. The cathedral's design follows that of contemporary tented churches, notably those of Ascension in Kolomenskoye (1530) and of St John the Baptist's Decapitation in Dyakovo (1547).[PARAGRAPH:2]The interior of the cathedral is a collection of separate chapels, each filled with icons, medieval painted walls, and varying artwork on the top inside of the domes. The feeling is intimate and varied, in contrast to Western cathedrals which usually consist of a massive nave with one artistic style.[PARAGRAPH:2]In a garden at the front of the cathedral stands a bronze statue commemorating Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin, who rallied Russia's volunteer army against the Polish invaders during the Time of Troubles in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]The initial concept was to build a cluster of chapels, one dedicated to each of the saints on whose feast day the tsar had won a battle, but the construction of a single central tower unifies these spaces into a single cathedral. A popular historical legend says that Ivan had the architect, Postnik Yakovlev, blinded to prevent him from building a more magnificent building for anyone else. In fact, Postnik Yakovlev built a number of churches after Saint Basil's, including one in Kazan'.</English>

It lies on Piazza San Marco adjacent and connected to the Doge's Palace. Originally it was the "chapel" of the Venetian rulers, and not the city's cathedral. Since 1807 it has been the seat of the Patriarch of Venice, archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice. For its opulent design, gilded Byzantine mosaics, and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, from the 11th century on the building was known by the nickname Chiesa d'Oro (Church of gold).[PARAGRAPH:2]The first San Marco's was a temporary building in the Doge's Palace, constructed in 828, when Venetian merchants stole the supposed relics of San Marco the Evangelist from Alexandria. This was replaced by a new church on its present site in 832; from the same century dates the first San Marco's Campanile (bell tower). The new church was burned in a rebellion in 976, rebuilt in 978 and again to form the basis of the present basilica since 1063. The basilica was consecrated in 1094, the same year in which the body of San Marco was supposedly rediscovered in a pillar by Vitale Faliero, doge at the time. The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing San Marco's Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace. Within the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new faade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the domes were covered with higher wooden, lead-covered domes in order to blend in with the Gothic architecture of the redesigned Doge's Palace.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Dome of the Rock is located at the visual center of an ancient man-made platform known as the Temple Mount, which Muslims refer to as the "Noble Sanctuary". The platform, greatly enlarged under the rule of Herod the Great, is the site of the Second Jewish Temple which was destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In 637 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate army during the Islamic invasion of the Byzantine Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dome of the Rock was erected between 685 and 691 CE. The names of the two engineers in charge of the project are given as: Yazid Ibn Salam from Jerusalem and Raja Ibn Haywah from Baysan. Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who initiated construction of the Dome, hoped that it would "house the Muslims from cold and heat" and intended the building to serve as a shrine for pilgrims and not as a mosque for public worship. Historians contend that the Caliph wished to create a structure which would compete with the existing buildings of other religions in the city. al-Maqdisi writes that he "Sought to build for the Muslims a masjid that should be unique and a wonder to the world. And in like manner, is it not evident that Caliph Abd al-Malik, seeing the greatness of the martyrium of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and its magnificence was moved lest it should dazzle the minds of Muslims and hence erected above the Rock the dome which is now seen there."[PARAGRAPH:2]During the Crusades the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104. The Knights Templar, who believed the Dome of the Rock was the site of the Temple of Solomon, set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The "Templum Domini," as they called it, was featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters, and it became the architectural model for Templar churches across Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on Friday, 2 October 1187 and the Haram was reconsecrated as a Muslim sanctuary. The cross on top of the Dome of the Rock was replaced by a golden crescent and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Salah al-Din's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa (615-24/1218-27) carried out other restorations within the Haram and added the porch to the Aqsa mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]Large-scale renovation was undertaken during the reign of Mahmud II in 1817. Adjacent to the Dome of the Rock, the Ottomans built the free-standing Dome of the Prophet in 1620.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dome of the Rock was badly shaken during an earthquake in Palestine on Monday, 11 July 1927 rendering useless many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under Jordanian rule of Jerusalem, Jews were forbidden from entering the Old City. Israel took control of the Dome of the Rock during its victory in the Six-Day War in 1967. A few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967, at the conclusion of the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of General Moshe Dayan, and invested the Muslim Waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount-Haram al-Sharif in order to "keep the peace".[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dome of the Rock, being among a complex of buildings on the Temple Mount, (the other principal building being the Al-Aqsa Mosque) is one of the holiest sites in Islam, following Mecca, Medina, and, for shia Muslims, the Imam Ali Mosque. Its significance stems from the religious beliefs regarding the rock at its heart. According to Islamic tradition, the rock is the spot from where Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel.[PARAGRAPH:2]The stone over which the Muslim shrine, the Dome of Rock, was built is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews have traditionally regarded the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies during the Temple Period. In former times, some Jewish scholars thought that the location of the Holy of Holies was not known for certain. Today this is a minority opinion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Just as Muslims pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, Jews pray towards the site of the ancient Holy of Holies, the Foundation Stone, the holiest site in Judaism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Christianity it is believed that during the time of the Byzantine Empire, nearby the spot where the Dome was later constructed was where Constantine's mother built a small church, calling it the Church of St. Cyrus and St. John, later on enlarged and called the Church of the Holy Wisdom. On the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a mosaic frieze that includes the following words:[PARAGRAPH:2]"Bless your envoy and your servant Jesus son of Mary and peace upon him on the day of birth and on the day of death and on the day he is raised up again. It is a word of truth in which they doubt. It is not for God to take a son. Glory be to him when he decrees a thing he only says be, and it is."</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Mezquita (Spanish for "mosque") of Crdoba or Cordova is a Roman Catholic cathedral originally built as a mosque in the Andalusian city of Crdoba, Spain. It is regarded as perhaps the most accomplished monument of the Umayyad dynasty of Crdoba. After the Spanish Reconquista, it was turned into a church, with a Gothic cathedral inserted into the center of the large Moorish building. Today the entire building is used to house the Cathedral of the diocese of Crdoba in Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]The building was begun in approximately 600 A.D. as the Christian Visigothic church of St. Vincent. The first Muslim Emir Abd ar-Rahman I bought the church and reworked it over two centuries to refashion it as a mosque, starting in 784 A.D. Additionally, Abd ar-Rahman I used the mosque (originally called Aljama Mosque) as an adjunct to his palace and named it to honor his wife. According to some authors the church of St. Vincent was demolished after it was bought from the local Christian community.[PARAGRAPH:2]Several explanations have been proposed to explain the mosque's unorthodox orientation. Some have suggested the mihrab faces south because the foundations of the mosque were taken from the old Roman and Visigoth constructions. Others contend that Abd ar-Rahman oriented the mihrab southward as if he were still in the Ummayyad capital of Damascus and not in exile.[PARAGRAPH:2]The mosque underwent numerous subsequent changes: Abd ar-Rahman III ordered a new minaret; Al-Hakam II, in 961, enlarged the building and enriched the mihrab. The last of the reforms was carried out by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir in 987.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was the most magnificent of the more than 1,000 mosques in the city and was at one time the second largest mosque in the Muslim world. It was connected to the Caliph's palace by a raised walk-way, mosques within the palaces being the tradition for the Islamic rulers of all times.[PARAGRAPH:2]The city in which it was built was subject to frequent invasion and each conquering wave added their own mark to the architecture. The building is most notable for its giant arches, with over 1,000 columns of jasper, onyx, marble, and granite. These were made from pieces of the Roman temple which had occupied the site previously, as well as other destroyed Roman buildings. The double arches, pictured above, were a new introduction to architecture, and helped support the tremendous weight of the higher ceilings. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The Mezquita also features richly gilded prayer niches. A centrally located honey-combed dome has beautiful blue tiles decorated with stars. The mihrab is a masterpiece of architectural art, with geometric and flowing designs of plants. The Mezquita reached its current dimensions in 987 A.D. with the completion of the outer naves and orange tree courtyard.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1236, Crdoba was recaptured from the Muslim army by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the mosque was reconsecrated as a Christian church. Alfonso X oversaw the construction of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. The kings who followed added further Christian features: Enrique II rebuilt the chapel in the 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The most significant alteration was building a Renaissance cathedral nave in the middle of the structure. It was constructed by permission of Charles V, king of united Spain. Its reversion to a Christian church (officially the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin) may have helped to preserve it when the Spanish Inquisition was most active.[PARAGRAPH:2]Artisans and architects continued to add to the existing structure until the late 18th century.</English>

    <Chinese>[标签]Cordova（西班牙语中的“清真寺”）是一座罗马天主教大教堂，最初在西班牙Crdoba的安达卢西亚市作为清真寺建造。它被认为可能是Crdoba倭玛亚王朝最为成功的纪念碑。西班牙重新征服后，它变成了一座教堂，一座哥特式大教堂插入了摩尔人的大建筑中心。今天，整座建筑都被用来建造西班牙Crdoba教区的大教堂。[第2段]这座建筑大约在公元600年作为圣文森特基督教西哥特式教堂开始建造。第一个穆斯林埃米尔阿布德・拉赫曼我买下了这座教堂，并在两个多世纪的时间里对其进行了改造，从公元784年开始将其改建为清真寺。此外，阿布德・拉赫曼一世还将这座清真寺（最初称为阿尔贾马清真寺）用作其宫殿的附属建筑，并将其命名为纪念他的妻子。根据一些作者的说法，圣文森特教堂是从当地基督教社区买来的，后来被拆毁了。[第2段]有人提出了几种解释来解释清真寺的非正统取向。一些人认为米哈拉布朝南，因为清真寺的地基取自古罗马和西哥特建筑。另一些人则认为，阿卜杜・拉赫曼将米哈拉布朝南，就好像他仍在大马士革的乌迈耶首都，没有流亡一样。[第2段]清真寺随后经历了许多变化：阿卜杜・拉赫曼三世下令修建一座新的尖塔；哈卡姆二世于961年扩建了这座建筑，充实了米哈拉布。最后一次改革是由曼苏尔・伊本・阿比・阿迈尔于987年进行的。[第2段]这是该市1000多座清真寺中最宏伟的一座，同时也是穆斯林世界第二大清真寺。它与哈里发的宫殿通过一条凸起的人行道相连，宫殿内的清真寺一直是伊斯兰统治者的传统。这座建筑以其巨大的拱门而闻名，有超过1000根由碧玉、玛瑙、大理石和花岗岩组成的柱子。这些建筑是由先前占领此地的罗马神庙以及其他被摧毁的罗马建筑碎片制成的。上图所示的双拱门是建筑的新入门，有助于支撑更高天花板的巨大重量。双拱由下马蹄形拱和上半圆拱组成。梅兹基塔也有很多镀金的祈祷壁龛。一个中心位置的蜂巢穹顶有美丽的蓝色瓷砖装饰的星星。米哈拉布是一个建筑艺术杰作，几何和流动的植物设计。公元987年，随着外中殿和橘子树庭院的完工，麦兹基塔达到了现在的规模。[第2段]1236年，卡斯蒂利亚国王费迪南德三世从穆斯林军队手中夺回了Crdoba，清真寺被重新封为基督教会。阿方索十世在清真寺内监督了维拉维西奥萨小教堂和皇家小教堂的建设。后来的国王们又增添了更多的基督教特色：恩里克二世在14世纪重建了这座小教堂。[第2段]最显著的变化是在教堂结构中间建造了一座文艺复兴时期的大教堂中殿。它是经西班牙联合国王查理五世许可建造的。在西班牙宗教裁判所最为活跃的时候，它恢复为基督教教堂（官方称为圣母升天大教堂）可能有助于保护它。[第2段]直到18世纪末，工匠和建筑师继续在现有的结构中添加新的元素。</Chinese>

The abbey and its constellation of dependencies soon came to exemplify the kind of religious life that was at the heart of 11th-century piety. The town of Cluny, in the modern department of Sane-et-Loire in the region of Bourgogne, in east-central France, near Mcon, grew round the former abbey, founded in a forested hunting reserve.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Benedictine order was a keystone to the stability that European society achieved in the 11th century, and partly owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed Benedictine rule, Cluny became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. A sequence of highly competent abbots of Cluny were statesmen on an international stage. The monastery of Cluny itself became the grandest, most prestigious and best endowed monastic institution in Europe. The height of Cluniac influence was from the second half of the 10th century through the early 12th. The abbey was sacked and mostly destroyed in 1790 during the French Revolution, and only a small part of the original remains.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The original walls of Constantinople were built in the 8th century BC when Byzantium was founded by Greek colonists from Megara. At the time the city consisted of an acropolis and little more. The colony was relatively unimportant by the Roman period, but Septimius Severus built a new set of walls during his reign, bringing more land into the city. When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople, he greatly expanded the walls of the city, incorporating even more territory.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 412 the Roman emperor Theodosius II surrounded Constantinople with a wall that stretched 6.5 kilometers between the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn. Although named after Theodosius, they were actually constructed under the direction of Anthemius, Praetorian prefect of the Eastern Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The walls were built of stone and brick in two lines of defense which adjoined a ditch 20 meters wide and 10 meters deep. The inner wall had was 5 meters thick and 12 meters high. It was strengthened with 96 unapproachable towers 18-20 meters tall. The thickness of the external wall was 2 meters, and its height was 8.5 meters. The wall contained the Belgrad, Silivrikapi, Mevlevihane, Topkapi, Edirnekapi, Egrikapi and Yedikule gates. Yedikule Gate was also known as the "Porta Aurea" or "Golden Gate", and was the most magnificent, consisting of three archways. As the state entrance into the capital, the Golden Gate was architecturally splendid, and was built of large square blocks of polished marble fitted together without cement, and flanked by two great towers of the same material. Upon the gates were placed sculpted elephants.[PARAGRAPH:2]The inner walls had massive square or hexagonal towers. The southern end of the walls, at the Sea of Marmara, was the location of the Marble Tower. There were ten gates, the four major ones being the Golden Gate at the southern end, the Selymbria Gate leading to the Forum of Constantine and Hagia Sophia, the Adrianople Gate connecting Constantinople's Mese (the main street) with the city of Adrianople and the Via Egnatia, and the Blachernae Gate in the north.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 439 the first sea walls were built. In 447 the wall was damaged by an earthquake, but was quickly restored in time to stop Attila's army. In the northwestern corner of the city, in the suburb of Blachernae, the Theodosian walls were relatively weaker, but were expanded by Leo I. The northern coast of the city, along the Golden Horn, also had a separate set of walls.[PARAGRAPH:2]These walls were almost inpenetrable, saving the city during sieges from the Bulgars, Arabs, and Rus', among others. The first attackers to break through the walls were the knights of the Fourth Crusade, who managed to scale the lower sea walls and also break the Wall of Leo in the northwestern Blachernae section of the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The second and final time the walls were breached was during the Siege of Constantinople in 1453, by the Ottomans; however, they did not break through by force, but entered through the Kerkoporta Gate, which happened to be open, apparently accidentally but possibly through treachery. A large plaque today marks the spot where the Ottomans entered. Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects. Within a few years, due to the renewed importance of the city as the new Ottoman capital, the population started to soar again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Ottomans, the Golden Gate, known to them as Yedikule ("the Seven Towers"), was used as a prison. Many parts of the walls are still standing today and are a testament to the extraordinary longevity of the empire. They have been damaged by recent earthquakes, but many sections have also been restored. The wall runs through the suburbs of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland flanking their course. The walls are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city.</English>

The palace stands on the top of a hill above the town of Sintra, and on a clear day it can be easily seen from Lisbon.[PARAGRAPH:2]The palace's history started in the Middle Ages when a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Pena was built on the top of the hill above Sintra. According to tradition, the construction occurred after an apparition of the Virgin Mary. In 1493, King John II, accompanied by his wife Queen Leonor, made a pilgrimage to the site to fulfill a vow. His successor, King Manuel I, was also very fond of this sanctuary, and ordered the construction there of a monastery which was donated to the Order of Saint Jerome.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 18th century the monastery was severely damaged by lightning. However, it was the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, occurring shortly afterwards, that took the heaviest toll on the monastery, reducing it to ruins. Nonetheless, the chapel (and its magnificent works of marble and alabaster attributed to Nicolau Chanterene) escaped without significant damage.[PARAGRAPH:2]A couple decades later King consort Ferdinand II decided to acquire the old monastery, all of the surrounding lands, the nearby Castle of the Moors and a few other estates in the area. Later as king he set out to transform the remains of the monastery into a palace that would serve as a summer residence for the Portuguese royal family.[PARAGRAPH:2]The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal.</English>

In the 15th and early 16th centuries, maritime exploration during the Age of Discovery made Lisbon an increasingly important port city, responsible for the commerce between the nascent Portuguese Empire and Africa and India. In this context, King Manuel I decided, around 1500, to build a new royal palace on the banks of the Tagus river (the Ribeira), completely changing the urban landscape of the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Ribeira Palace was finished around 1511. King Manuel I and the court were now close to the commercial and industrial heart of the city. The areas around the palace were occupied by the harbour, the shipbuilding area (the so-called Ribeira das Naus), customs and other buildings responsible for the regulation of maritime commerce.[PARAGRAPH:2]On the 1st of November of 1755, a huge earthquake, and resulting tsunami and fire destroyed the palace and most of Lisbon.

    <English>[TAB]Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was an Italian polymath, being a scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, painter, sculptor, architect, botanist, musician and writer. Born as the illegitimate son of a notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, at Vinci in the region of Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter, Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice and spent his last years in France, at the home awarded him by King Franois I.[PARAGRAPH:2]Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the "Renaissance man", a man whose seemingly infinite curiosity was equalled only by his powers of invention. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]As an engineer, Leonardo's ideas were vastly ahead of his time. He conceptualised a helicopter, a tank, concentrated solar power, a calculator, the double hull and outlined a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As a scientist, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev is an outstanding architectural monument of Kievan Rus'. Today, it is one of the city's best known landmarks and the first Ukrainian patrimony to be inscribed on the World Heritage List.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cathedral's name comes from the 6th-century Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople (meaning Holy Wisdom, and dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God rather than a specific saint named Sophia). According to a less popular theory, its model was the 13-domed oaken Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (ca. 989), which Yaroslav I the Wise determined to imitate in stone as a sign of gratitude to the citizens of Novgorod who had helped him secure the Kievan throne in 1019.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first foundations were laid in 1037, but the cathedral took two decades to complete. The structure has 5 naves, 5 apses, and (quite surprisingly for Byzantine architecture) 13 cupolas. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring 37 to 55 m (121 to 180 ft), the exterior used to be faced with plinths. On the inside, it retains mosaics and frescos from the eleventh century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the Virgin Orans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including Vladimir Monomakh, Vsevolod Yaroslavich and of course the cathedral's founder Yaroslav I the Wise, although only the latter's grave survived to our days (see picture).[PARAGRAPH:2]After the pillaging of Kiev by Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal in 1169, followed by Mongolian Tatars in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. Following the 1595-96 Union of Brest, the cathedral of Saint Sophia belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church until it was claimed by the Moldavian Orthodox metropolitan Peter Mogila (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect Octaviano Mancini in the distinct Ukrainian Baroque style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa, and in 1740 the Cathedral was completed to its present form.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and during the Soviet antireligious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park "Heroes of Perekop" (after a Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War in Crimea). The cathedral was saved from destruction primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, Soviet authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding seventeenth-eighteenth century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.[PARAGRAPH:2]Since the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various schisms and factions within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, other times they are denied access. Most memorable was the funeral of Patriarch Volodymyr of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy, when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place. After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.[PARAGRAPH:2]The complex of the Cathedral is the main component the National Sanctuary "Sophia of Kiev" the state institution responsible for the preservation of the Cathedral complex along with several other historic landmarks of the city.</English>

    <Chinese>[标签]基辅圣索菲亚大教堂是基辅罗斯杰出的建筑纪念碑。今天，它是该市最著名的地标之一，也是第一个被列入世界遗产名录的乌克兰遗产。[第2段]大教堂的名字来自6世纪君士坦丁堡的圣索菲亚大教堂（Hagia Sophia cathedral）（意思是神圣智慧，致力于上帝的神圣智慧，而不是一个叫索菲亚的特定圣人）。根据一个不太流行的理论，它的模型是诺夫哥罗德的13个圆顶的奥肯圣索菲亚大教堂（约989年），雅罗斯拉夫一世（Yaroslav I the Wise）决心用石头来模仿，以此表示对帮助他在1019年获得基辅王位的诺夫哥罗德市民的感激，但大教堂花了20年才完工。这座建筑有5个中殿、5个后堂和13个圆屋顶（对于拜占庭建筑来说，这是相当令人惊讶的）。它被三面的两层画廊所包围。它的外形尺寸在37到55米（121到180英尺）之间，以前是面对底座的。在内部，它保留了11世纪的马赛克和壁画，包括一个破旧的雅罗斯拉夫家族和圣母圣殿的代表。[第2段]最初，这座大教堂是基辅统治者的埋葬地，包括弗拉基米尔・莫纳巴赫、维斯韦洛德・雅罗斯拉夫维奇，当然还有大教堂的创始人雅罗斯拉夫一世，尽管只有后者的坟墓保存到我们的时代（见图片）。[第2段]在1169年弗拉基米尔苏兹达尔的安德烈・博戈里苏斯基（Andrei Bogolyubsky）掠夺基辅，1240年蒙古鞑靼人（Mongol Tatars）掠夺之后，大教堂陷入了年久失修的境地。继1595-1596年布雷斯特联盟之后，圣索菲亚大教堂一直属于乌克兰希腊天主教堂，直到1633年被摩尔达维亚东正教大都会彼得・莫吉拉（Mohyla）占领。莫吉拉委托修复工作，建筑上部被彻底重建，由意大利建筑师奥克塔维亚诺・曼奇尼以鲜明的乌克兰巴洛克风格仿制，同时保留了拜占庭式的内部，保持了它的辉煌。在哥萨克・赫特曼・伊万・马泽帕（Ivan Mazepa）的领导下，这项工程继续进行，1740年，这座大教堂在1917年俄罗斯革命后和20世纪20年代苏联反宗教运动期间完成了目前的形式，政府的计划要求摧毁大教堂，并将其改造成公园“佩雷科普英雄”（在克里米亚的俄罗斯内战中取得红军胜利后）。这座大教堂主要是经过许多科学家和历史学家的努力才免于毁坏。然而，在1934年，苏联当局没收了教堂的建筑，包括周围的17-18世纪建筑群，并将其指定为建筑和历史博物馆。[第2段]自20世纪80年代末苏联，后来乌克兰，政客们答应把这座建筑物还给东正教。由于教会内部的各种分裂和派系，返回被推迟，因为所有东正教和希腊天主教会都要求返回。尽管所有的东正教教堂都被允许在不同的日期进行礼拜，但其他时候却被拒绝进入。最令人难忘的是乌克兰东正教-基辅父权制教长沃洛德迈尔的葬礼，当时防暴警察被迫阻止在博物馆内举行葬礼，并发生了流血冲突。在这些事件之后，没有任何宗教团体获得了定期服务的权利。该建筑群现在仍然是乌克兰基督教博物馆，大部分游客都是游客。[第2段]大教堂建筑群是国家保护区“基辅索菲亚”的主要组成部分，国家保护机构负责保护大教堂建筑群以及该市其他几处历史地标性建筑。</Chinese>

    <English>[TAB]The Palais des Papes is a historical palace in Avignon, southern France, one of the largest and most important medieval Gothic buildings in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Avignon became the residence of the Popes in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as Pope Clement V, unwilling to face the violent chaos of Rome after his election (1305), moved the Papal Curia to Avignon, a period known as the Avignon Papacy. Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor Pope John XXII set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by Pope Benedict XII (1334-42) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river Rhne, was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the Palais Vieux (Old Palace) and Palais Neuf (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of 11,000 m?(2.6 acres). The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of Pope Benedict XII. The austere Benedict had the old/new episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centreed on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V, the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. Jean de Louvres was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.[PARAGRAPH:2]The popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the Papal Schism during which time the antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII made Avignon their home until 1408. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for ten years after being besieged when in 1398 Geoffrey Boucicaut led an army of occupation. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years - it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 - but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and Comtat Venaissin) for over 350 years afterwards, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Palais was subsequently taken over by the Napoleonic French state for use as a military barracks and prison. Although it was further damaged by the military occupation, especially under the anti-clerical Third Republic, when the remaining interior woodwork was cleared away for use of the structure as a stables - the frescos were covered over and largely destroyed - ironically this ensured the shell of the building's physical survival. It was only vacated in 1906, when it became a national museum. It has been under virtually constant restoration ever since.[PARAGRAPH:2]The majority of the Palais is now open to the public; it also houses a large convention centre and the archives of the dpartement of Vaucluse.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Belm Tower is a fortified tower located in the Belm district of Lisbon, Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Belm Tower was built in the early sixteenth century in the Portuguese late-Gothic style, the Manueline, to commemorate Vasco da Gama's expedition. This defensive, yet elegant construction has become one of the symbols of the city, a memorial to Portuguese power as it was during the Age of Discovery. In 1983, it was classified, together with the nearby Mosteiro dos Jernimos (Jernimos Monastery), as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Belm Tower was built both as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon and as part of a defensive system at the entrance to the Tagus river. The system was initiated by King John II (1455-1495), who built the Fortress of Cascais and the Fortress of So Sebastio of Caparica. The shore of Belm had been protected by a ship, the Grande Nau, but it was replaced by the Tower of Belm during the last five years of the reign of King Manuel I. It was dedicated to the patron saint of Lisbon, St Vincent.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower was constructed, between 1515 and 1521, by the military architect, Francisco de Arruda, who had already built several fortresses in Portuguese territories in Morocco. The influence of Moorish architecture is manifest in the delicate decorations, the arched windows, the balconies, and the ribbed cupolas of the watchtowers. Diogo de Boitaca, the first architect of the nearby Monastery of the Jernimos, probably also participated in decorating the building. The machicolation and the battlements are decorated with the rich sculptural ornamentation of the Manueline style.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally, the tower stood on a little island near the right bank of the Tagus, opposite Restelo beach. With the progressive southward creep of the shoreline over the years, the tower is now practically 'moored' to the bank itself.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1580, when Lisbon was invaded by Spanish troops in the course of a struggle for the Portuguese throne, defenders of the tower fought and surrendered to the Duke of Alba. During subsequent centuries, the tower was mainly used as a prison (even though the cellars flooded regularly) and as a custom house. Indeed, given its height and lack of integration into the landscape, some historians believe the tower was always intended to serve as a customs outpost.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 1840s, at the urging of romantic writer Almeida Garrett, the Tower of Belm was restored by King Ferdinand II. At that point, many neo-Manueline decorative elements were added to the building. It was declared a National Monument in 1910.</English>

At the king's death, the library consisted of about 3,000 codices or "Corvinae" which included 4,000-5,000 works, mainly of classical Greek and Latin authors.

The palace as it is today is the work of many French monarchs, building on an early 16th century structure of Francis I. The building is arranged around a series of courtyards. The city of Fontainebleau has grown up around the remainder of the Forest of Fontainebleau, a former royal hunting park.[PARAGRAPH:2]The palace introduced to France the Italian Mannerist style in interior decoration and in gardens, and transformed them in the translation. The French Mannerist style of interior decoration of the 16th century is known as the "Fontainebleau style": it combined sculpture, metalwork, painting, stucco and woodwork, and outdoors introduced the patterned garden parterre. The Fontainebleau style combined allegorical paintings in moulded plasterwork where the framing was treated as if it were leather or paper, slashed and rolled into scrolls and combined with arabesques and grotesques. Fontainebleau ideals of female beauty are Mannerist: a small neat head on a long neck, exaggeratedly long torso and limbs, small high breasts; almost a return to Late Gothic beauties. The new works at Fontainebleau were recorded in refined and detailed engravings that circulated among connoisseurs and artists. Through the engravings by the "School of Fontainebleau" this new style was transmitted to other northern European centres, Antwerp especially, and Germany, and eventually London.</English>

It started as a convention of the dukes of the old Germanic tribes that formed the Frankish kingdom when important decisions had to be made, probably based on the old Germanic law that each leader relied on the support of his leading men. For example, already under Charlemagne, the Reichstag in Aachen in 802/803 officially declared the laws of the Saxons and other tribes. The Reichstag of 919 in Fritzlar elected the first king of the Germans who was a Saxon, Henry the Fowler, thus overcoming the longstanding rivalry between Franks and Saxons and laying the foundation for the German Empire. In 1158, the Reichstag in Roncaglia finalized four laws that would significantly alter the (never formally written) constitution of the Empire, marking the beginning of the steady decline of the central power in favor of the local dukes. In 1356, the Golden Bull cemented the concept of Landesherrschaft ("territorial rule"), the largely independent rule of the dukes over their respective territories.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Nicolaus Copernicus (19 February 1473 - 24 May 1543) was the first astronomer to formulate a comprehensive heliocentric cosmology, which displaced the Earth from the center of the universe. His epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), published in 1543 just before his death, is often regarded as the starting point of modern astronomy and the defining epiphany that began the scientific revolution. His heliocentric model, with the Sun at the center of the universe, demonstrated that the observed motions of celestial objects can be explained without putting Earth at rest in the center of the universe. His work stimulated further scientific investigations, becoming a landmark in the history of science that is often referred to as the Copernican Revolution.[PARAGRAPH:2]Among the great polymaths of the Renaissance, Copernicus was a mathematician, astronomer, physician, quadrilingual polyglot, classical scholar, translator, artist, Catholic cleric, jurist, governor, military leader, diplomat and economist. Among his many responsibilities, astronomy figured as little more than an avocation - yet it was in that field that he made his mark upon the world.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Palace of Versailles began life as a hunting lodge constructed at the instructions of King Louix XIII, who enjoyed hunting in the nearby woods. In 1660, his son Louis XIV decided to turn the "chateau" into a palace. Louis XIV took up residence in 1682, and construction on the palace was completed in 1688. During Louis' lifetime this huge, ungainly, and ornate building was not only his residence, but it also housed the royal court and central bureaucracy of France. Versailles is a complex of richly appointed buildings centered in one-and-a-half square miles of fine parkland. It is surrounded by beautiful fountains, statues, and magnificent formal gardens. [PARAGRAPH:2]At the very center of the palace was, of course, Louis' bedroom, a massive and ostentatious room. At the center of the bedroom was the Royal Bed, which was surrounded by a railing, suggesting that the king did indeed hold large audiences while reclining in the bed and needed a way to keep the visitors' fingers from messing up the royal linens. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Hall of Mirrors is another impressive room in Versailles. Over 200 feet in length and 30 feet wide, the hall contains 578 mirrors and 17 ornate windows. On the ceiling Louis had painted 30 pictures showing his many triumphs and the benefits of his rule. [PARAGRAPH:2]While appearing to many a massive exercise in royal excess, Louis had good reason for constructing Versailles; with one stroke he removed the nobility and bureaucracy from the intrigues of Paris and made them more immediately responsible to him. In this way he was able to render the once powerful nobility largely impotent; great families which had once battled each other for the throne of France now found themselves instead intriguing for the privilege of attending Louis' bath. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nonetheless, Versailles was, in fact, an extraordinarily expensive building. It has been estimated that maintaining the palace and its noble denizens consumed 6%% of the entire French national budget. For a comparison, the United States' President's 2006 budget estimates that the US will take in about 2.2 trillion dollars in revenue in 2006. Six percent of that amount is 132 billion dollars. [PARAGRAPH:2]After the French Revolution and the dissolution of the monarchy, Versailles fell into disrepair and disuse. The German Army made the complex its headquarters after defeating France in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. The building remained in decay until the 1960s, when Pierre Verlet conceived the bold idea of refurbishing Versailles to its glory days under Louis XIV. Since then the curators have managed to retrieve many of the original furnishings from across Europe.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Pressburg Castle is the main castle of Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian), one of the most important forts in medieval Hungary. The massive rectangular building with four corner towers stands on a quite isolated rocky hill of the Little Carpathians directly above the Danube river in the middle of Pozsony.[PARAGRAPH:2]The construction of the current castle of stone started in the 10th century, but it was not finished. Under King Stephen I of Hungary (I. Istvn, 1000-1038), however, the castle was already one of the central castles of the Kingdom of Hungary. It became the seat of a county (Pozsony county), protected the kingdom against Bohemian (Czech) and German attacks (e.g. in 1030, 1042, 1052, 1108, 1146) and played an important role in throne struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g. struggles after the death of King Stephen I). In 1052 Henry III tried to occupy the castle. However Zothmund a Hungarian soldier, swam to the ships of the invading fleet to drill holes in them, and they were sunk. King Solomon of Hungary had lived here until he was taken to the jail of Nyitra according to Ladislaus I's (I. Lszl? 1077-1095) order. At the same time the old rampart was modernized and the Church of the St. Savior with a chapter and a church school were added. Stephen III of Hungary (III. Istvn, 1162-1172) escaped from his enemies to the castle almost 100 years later.[PARAGRAPH:2]The well-fortified Pressburg Castle was among the few castles of the Kingdom of Hungary to be able to withstand Mongol attacks in 1241 and 1242. As a reaction to these attacks, a huge "tower for the protection of the kingdom" was constructed at the castle building in 1245 immediately next to two older palaces. The tower was actually a huge high residential building. In addition, 7 (genuine) square towers were built into the old rampart and a stone wall was added around the castle proper (i.e. the residential building). The biggest of the rampart towers was at the same time a corner tower of the stone wall. Today it is a part of the castle building - it is identical with the present-day "Crown tower", which is the biggest one of today's four towers of the castle building. It was probably built around 1250 when Knights of St. John were active at the castle.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1536 (de facto already in 1531), after the Ottoman Empire had conquered a significant part of present-day Hungary, Pressburg became the capital (seat of the Diet and of central authorities, place of coronations) of the remaining Kingdom of Hungary, which was renamed Royal Hungary and was de facto ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs. Consequently, Pressburg Castle became the most important royal castle and the formal seat of the kings of Royal Hungary (who however resided in Vienna normally). At the same time, from the beginning of the 16th century, Pressburg and its castle had to face various anti-Habsburg uprisings in Royal Hungary. For example, troops of Gbor Bethlen occupied the castle between 1619 and 1621, when it was reconquered by imperial (Austrian) troops, and had the royal crown removed from Pressburg Castle till 1622. Between 1671 and 1677, Pressburg Castle was home to an extraordinary court against the Protestants and participants of anti-Habsburg uprisings. Imre Thkly, the leader of another big anti-Habsburg uprising, failed to conquer the castle in 1682-83.[PARAGRAPH:2]In terms of the castle's functions after 1530, the castle was home to selected participants of Diet meetings (including apartments of the king/emperor, which have been already there since the Gothic reconstruction), to some central authorities of Royal Hungary, the county head of Pozsony etc., to the apartment of the Governor of Royal Hungary (usually a brother of the emperor), and since 1552, the crown jewels were deposited here as well - in what is today known as the Crown Tower. Initial and final meetings of the Diet took place in the castle too.</English>

The palace was a setting for state occasions and royal entertainments and is a major tourist attraction today. The name directly translates as "Cannongate Palace", from the palace being named after a nearby, now lost gate.[PARAGRAPH:2]The initial construction started in 1459, ordered by Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Byzantine Constantinople. The palace is a complex made up of four main courtyards and many smaller buildings. At the height of its existence as a royal residence, the palace was home to as many as 4,000 people, formerly covering a larger area with a long shoreline. The complex has been expanded over the centuries, with many renovations such as after the 1509 earthquake and 1665 fire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Topkapi Palace gradually lost its importance at the end of the 17th century, as the Sultans preferred to spend more time in their new palaces along the Bosporus. In 1853, Sultan Abdl Mecid I decided to move the court to the newly built Dolmabahe Palace, the first European-style palace in the city. Some functions, such as the imperial treasury, the library, mosque and mint, were retained though.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1921, Topkapi Palace was transformed by government decree on April 3, 1924 into a museum of the imperial era. The Topkapi Palace Museum is under the administration of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The palace complex has hundreds of rooms and chambers, but only the most important are accessible to the public today. The complex is guarded by officials of the ministry as well as armed guards of the Turkish military. The palace is full of examples of Ottoman architecture and also contains large collections of porcelain, robes, weapons, shields, armor, Ottoman miniatures, Islamic calligraphic manuscripts and murals, as well as a display of Ottoman treasure and jewelry.[PARAGRAPH:2]Topkapi Palace is among those monuments belonging to the "Historic Areas of Istanbul", which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, and is described in Criterion iv as "the best example(s) of ensembles of palaces of the Ottoman period."</English>

    <Chinese>托普卡比宫是土耳其伊斯坦布尔的一座宫殿，1465年至1853年，托普卡比宫是奥斯曼苏丹的官方和主要居所。这座宫殿曾是国家庆典和皇家娱乐活动的场所，现在是一个主要的旅游景点。这个名字直接翻译为“坎农宫”，这座宫殿的名字来源于附近一座现已失传的城门。[第2段]最初的建造始于1459年，由拜占庭君士坦丁堡的征服者苏丹穆罕默德二世下令建造。这座宫殿是一个由四个主要庭院和许多较小的建筑组成的综合体。在皇宫作为皇家住宅的鼎盛时期，皇宫曾是4000多人的家园，以前占地面积更大，海岸线很长。这座建筑群经过几个世纪的扩建，在1509年的地震和1665年的火灾之后进行了许多翻修。[第2段]托普卡比宫在17世纪末逐渐失去了它的重要性，因为苏丹更愿意在博斯普鲁斯海峡沿岸的新宫殿里呆更多的时间。1853年，苏丹阿布德麦基德一世决定将宫廷迁至新建的多尔马巴宫，这是该城第一座欧式风格的宫殿。尽管如此，一些功能，如国库、图书馆、清真寺和造币厂仍然保留了下来。[第2段]1921年奥斯曼帝国结束后，托普卡皮宫在1924年4月3日被政府法令改建为帝国时代的博物馆。托普卡比故宫博物院隶属于文化和旅游部。皇宫建筑群有数百个房间和房间，但今天只有最重要的房间可以供公众使用。该建筑群由该部官员以及土耳其军方武装警卫看守。这座宫殿充满了奥斯曼式建筑的实例，还收藏了大量瓷器、长袍、武器、盾牌、盔甲、奥斯曼式微型模型、伊斯兰书法手稿和壁画，托普卡比宫是属于1985年成为联合国教科文组织世界遗产的“伊斯坦布尔历史区域”的纪念碑之一，在标准四中被描述为“奥斯曼时期宫殿群的最佳范例”</Chinese>

    <English>[TAB]The Lighthouse of Genoa (Italian: Faro di Genova, but simply called Lanterna), is the main lighthouse for the city's port. Besides being an important aid to night navigation in the vicinity, the tower serves as a symbol for the City of Genoa, and is one of the oldest standing structures of its kind in the world. It is built on the hill of San Benigno at some little distance from the Sampierdarena neighborhood. At 249 feet (76 m) it is the world's second tallest "traditional lighthouse" built of masonry. It is constructed in two square portions, each one capped by a terrace; the whole structure is crowned by a lantern from which the light is shone.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first tower at this location, a structure formed of three crenellated towers, was built, most sources say, around 1128, although at least one states that it was built in 1161. At the time it sat close to the main coastal road, called the Via di Francia, which more recent documents describe as passing between it and the sea. When it was constructed the tower was fairly far from the city; it was only in the seventeenth century that it became part of the so-called "Cerchia Seicentesca", part of the seicento city walls of Genoa. It has remained a part of the system until today.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dried pieces of erica and juniper wood were used to fuel the signal fire in its early years; for upkeep, navigators who used the port were expected to pay a tax upon their approach to the city. The tower also played a part, early in its career, in the ongoing feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines; during one battle, the Ghibellines damaged it considerably during an attempt to dislodge a group of Guelphs who had taken refuge inside. In 1318 and again in 1321, it was decided to dig a defensive trench around the tower, the better to protect it from damage in battle. In 1326 the first oil-based lantern, whose fire was fed by olive oil, was added to the structure, so that incoming vessels could better distinguish the signal fire upon approach. For the same reason, in 1340 the tower was painted with the coat of arms of the city, the better to serve as a distinctive daymark. In around 1400 the lighthouse was further converted for use as a prison; among the hostages therein accommodated were the king of Cyprus, James II, and his wife.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1405 the priests who were responsible for the upkeep of the lighthouse placed on its cupola a fish and a golden cross to serve as symbols of Christianity. During the cinquecento the structure was heavily damaged again, this time by friendly fire from the Genovese against the French. Thirty years later, in 1543, the tower was once again reconstructed, assuming the form in which it may still be seen today.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1449 one of the keepers of the lighthouse was listed as Antonio Colombo, uncle of explorer Christopher Columbus.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower was shelled during the bombardment of Genoa by the French in 1684; the windows which were damaged were replaced on the orders of Louis XIV in 1692. In 1778 construction began on a new lighting system designed to counteract damage done to the lighting apparatus over several centuries of use. In 1840 a rotating Fresnel lens was installed; the system was formally inaugurated in January 1841. It was modified up until the end of the century in order to increase its capability; the entire lighthouse was modernised again in 1913, but the electrification was poorly done, and had to be refitted in 1936. One last major restoration project, begun after American and British air attacks of World War II, was completed in 1956.</English>

    <English>[TAB]As a literary genre of high culture, romance or chivalric romance is a style of heroic prose and verse narrative that was popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about the marvelous adventures of a chivalrous, heroic knight errant, often of super-human ability, who often goes on a quest. Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric or burlesque intent. Romances reworked legends, fairy tales, and history to suit tastes, but by c.1600 they were out of fashion and Miguel de Cervantes famously satirised them in his novel Don Quixote.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally, romance literature was written in Old French, Anglo-Norman and Occitan, later, in English and German. During the early 13th century romances were increasingly written as prose. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of courtly love, such as faithfulness in adversity. From ca. 1800 the connotations of "romance" moved from the magical and fantastic to somewhat eerie "Gothic" adventure narratives.</English>

The private academy set up later in the century in Bologna by the Carracci brothers was also extremely influential, and with the Accademia di San Luca of Rome (founded 1593) helped to confirm the use of the term for these institutions.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Acadmie de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, established by the monarchy in 1648 (later renamed) was the most significant of the artistic academies, running the famous Salon exhibitions from 1725.

Students assembled in sessions drawing the draped and undraped human form, and such drawings, which survive in the tens of thousands from the 17th through the 19th century, are termed acadmies in French.[PARAGRAPH:2]Similar institutions were often established for other arts; Paris had the Acadmie Royale de Musique from 1669, and the Acadmie d'architecture from 1671.</English>
