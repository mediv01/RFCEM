    <English>[H1]Justinian I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Byzantine Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 11, 483 - November 13, 565 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Justinian the First, known as Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus in Latin, was emperor of the Byzantine Empire from 527 until his death in 565. His four decades of rule marked the greatest expansion of the Byzantine Empire since its split with the Roman Empire and a sweeping revival in the Christian religion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born in a small village in modern Macedonia, Justinian had little connection to power in Constantinople as a youth. It was the rise of his uncle, Justin, a Byzantine general who succeeded the Emperor Anastasius, which drew young Justinian from the Macedonian pastures into cosmopolitan Constantinople. Justinian served his uncle as a close advisor for a decade before the passing of Emperor Justin transferred the diadem to Justinian.[PARAGRAPH:2]With Justinian's rise to power, two other important faces rose to prominence. Belisarius, a close friend of Justinian, became the leader of Justinian's armies and proved himself as a brilliant tactician. The second face belonged to his beautiful and savvy wife, Theodora, who took on the role that Justinian himself once filled, that of the emperor's closest advisor.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of Justinian's first actions as Emperor was to order a collection of all Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis. But not long after the first issuing of the Corpus, an uprising among two rival chariot racing factions, the Blues and the Greens, engulfed Constantinople in a wave of violence and conflagration. Enterprising powers within the city allied against Justinian, using the chaos to declare a new Emperor, Hypatius, a nephew of Anastasius. Justinian, unsure of the strength of usurpers, decided to flee the city, but his brave wife refused. Instead, Belisarius was ordered to take two divisions and quell the uprising, which he did with ruthless ability, trapping rioters in the Hippodrome and killing nearly 30,000 before the riot was finally put down.[PARAGRAPH:2]The damage done to the city after the riots was substantial. Among the smoldering ruins lay the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople's greatest cathedral, burnt to the ground. Justinian thus began a monumental campaign to expand and restore the building. With its completion five years later, the reconstructed Hagia Sophia was christened as the world's largest cathedral, a title it would hold for a millennium. Under Justinian's order, twenty-five cathedrals were built in Constantinople alone, with many more built outside the capital city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Empire thrived under Justinian. Thanks in no small part to the able command of Belisarius, Emperor Justinian's reach spread from Constantinople to Southern Spain, with North Africa and Italy all falling under the Byzantine grasp. Justinian's reign marked a high point for the Byzantine Empire, as shortly after his death, much of the land conquered in his name was lost. War with powerful Germanic tribes and neighboring Persia would cost the empire much of its hard-fought gains.</English>

    <Chinese>[H1]查士丁尼一世[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]拜占庭帝国皇帝[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生前：[\BOLD]公元483年5月11日至565年11月13日[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB ]查士丁尼一世，拉丁语称为弗拉维乌斯・佩特罗斯・萨巴蒂斯・尤斯蒂尼亚努斯，从527年起一直是拜占庭帝国的皇帝，直到565年去世。查士丁尼四十年的统治标志着拜占庭帝国自与罗马帝国分裂以来的最大扩张和基督教的全面复兴。[PARAGRAPH:2]出生于现代马其顿的一个小村庄，年轻时与君士坦丁堡的权力关系不大。他的叔叔贾斯汀（Justin）是拜占庭将军，继承了阿纳斯塔修斯（Anastasius）皇帝，他的崛起将年轻的贾斯汀从马其顿牧场吸引到了世界性的君士坦丁堡。查士丁尼在皇帝查士丁尼去世前曾担任叔叔的亲密顾问十年。[PARAGRAPH:2]随着查士丁尼的掌权，另外两位重要人物也崭露头角。贝里萨里乌斯，查士丁尼的密友，成为查士丁尼军队的领袖，证明了自己是一位杰出的战术家。第二张脸属于他美丽而精明的妻子西奥多拉，她扮演了查士丁尼本人曾经担任的角色，即皇帝最亲密的顾问。[PARAGRAPH:2]查士丁尼作为皇帝的第一个行动之一是下令收集所有罗马法律，即《民法典》。但在第一次发布《文集》后不久，两个对立的战车竞赛派系――蓝军和绿军――之间的起义将君士坦丁堡卷入了一场暴力和大火的浪潮中。城内有进取心的力量联合起来对付查士丁尼，利用混乱宣布一位新皇帝，阿纳斯塔修斯的侄子海帕提乌斯。查士丁尼不确定篡位者的力量，决定逃离这座城市，但他勇敢的妻子拒绝了。相反，贝里萨里乌斯被命令分两个师镇压起义，他以残忍的手段镇压了起义，将暴乱者困在竞技场，并在暴乱最终平息之前杀害了近30000人。[PARAGRAPH:2]暴乱后对城市造成的破坏是巨大的。在阴燃的废墟中，君士坦丁堡最大的大教堂索菲亚大教堂被烧毁。查士丁尼因此开始了一场纪念性的扩建和修复活动。五年后完工，重建的索菲亚大教堂被命名为世界上最大的大教堂，这一称号将持续一千年。在查士丁尼的命令下，仅在君士坦丁堡就修建了25座大教堂，在首都城外还修建了更多的大教堂。[PARAGRAPH:2]查士丁尼统治下，帝国繁荣昌盛。在很大程度上要感谢贝里萨利斯的干练指挥，查士丁尼皇帝的势力范围从君士坦丁堡扩展到西班牙南部，北非和意大利都落入拜占庭的控制之下。查士丁尼的统治标志着拜占庭帝国的一个高峰，因为在他死后不久，以他的名义征服的大部分土地都消失了。与强大的日耳曼部落和邻国波斯的战争将使帝国损失其大部分艰苦奋斗的成果。</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]Charlemagne[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, King of the Franks[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 742 - January 28, 814 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Charles the Great, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, fathered a kingdom that encompassed France, Germany, Italy and much of Eastern Europe. Legends of his conquests are pervasive throughout history, and he is considered one of the great figureheads of European Chivalric society.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his lifetime Charlemagne successfully campaigned in many countries. Some wars he completed personally and others were left for his sons to finish. His first campaign was against Desiderius of Lombardy who, soon after the succession of Pope Hadrian I, marched on Rome. Charlemagne pressed into Lombardy, and after a lengthy siege (772-774), he accepted Desiderius' unconditional surrender. Desiderius would live out the remainder of his life confined to a monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]The longest lasting and most challenging conquest of Charlemagne's reign would be that of Saxonia. It would be a theater that he would continually revisit during his lifetime. After Charlemagne's initial push into Saxonia he was continuously forced to retake previously conquered land which had rebelled against his authority. Weary of war and losing more rights and freedoms with every capitulation, the Saxons eventually accepted Charlemagne's terms, including renouncement of their national religious customs and adoption of the Christian faith and its associated Frankish customs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles was both a highly religious man and a philanthropist. He often built friendly relationships with other countries, such as Egypt and India, so that he could later send money in an effort to assist struggling Christians in those regions. Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, Charles often contributed money to relieve the poor and sick in his kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charlemagne, despite being unable to write well himself, had a vast love of literature and education. Due to his conquests, Charlemagne came into contact with many different cultures and learning institutions. Having contributed considerable funding to existing monastic schools and institutions of learning, Charlemagne's era became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of both fictional and real people that represented the pinnacle of chivalry during their eras, Charlemagne was the embodiment of honor in both person and position. A conqueror, a philanthropist, lover of the arts and a highly devout Christian, Charlemagne stands as one of the important figures of the first millennium, and the forefather of Central Europe as it stands today. </English>

    <English>[H1]Louis XIV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of France[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] September 5, 1638 - September 1, 1715 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born to King Louis XIII of France, Louis XIV was raised in the most opulent court in Europe. His every need was catered to, and he was given an excellent education, even if he was too lazy and spoiled to appreciate it. Louis XIII died when his son was five, and the regency passed to the queen mother, Anne of Austria. For the next 18 years she ruled France with the able assistance of Cardinal Mazarin, who may or may not have also been her lover, while Louis lived in pampered splendor.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was upon Mazarin's death in 1661 that the 22-year-old Louis XIV began to take an active interest in ruling his country. Much to everyone's surprise, he was good at it. First he gathered all of the power into his own hands, bypassing the old bureaucratic patronage system that Mazarin and his predecessors had used. He enticed the great nobles to his court, where he heaped upon them titles, honorary positions, and financial rewards, while at the same time undermining their actual power. In Louis' court, great noblemen - whose parents had fought for the crown of France itself - fought each other for the privilege of watching Louis shave.[PARAGRAPH:2]In person Louis was said to possess a great natural dignity and bearing. He was unfailingly courteous and usually honest, but he could dissimulate with the best of them when need-be.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his early reign Louis's court was known for its debauchery, and Louis himself had several mistresses. As his reign progressed, however, Louis became more devout, and he even married his last mistress (although in secret). Louis also became a patron of the arts, and literature and painting flourished under his rule. He built many great buildings and palaces, including the grand palace at Versailles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite France's wealth, the country remained virtually bankrupt, not only because it had to pay for all the gifts that Louis gave his favorites, but, more importantly, it had to pay for all the wars of conquest that Louis embarked upon. Although a sound and thoughtful ruler at home, Louis had a great thirst for international "glory" - which in his terms meant victory on the battlefield. He constantly fought his neighbors, often for the most trivial reasons, gaining little but glory from the wars. Though he left the army and navy in splendid condition, he left his country's treasury bare.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a reign of 72 years, Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday. His body lies in Saint-Denis Basilica, outside Paris. Louis XIV is the longest reigning European monarch of all time.</English>

    <English>[H1]Elizabeth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Virgin Queen of England[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] September 7, 1533 - March 24, 1603 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born to King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, who her father had executed for failing to give him a male heir, Elizabeth's early life was filled with danger. Growing up an unwanted daughter of a insane father who was destroying England's ties to the Catholic Church and engaging in civil war so that he could legally marry another woman (several other women, in fact), Elizabeth had to use all of her wits to survive. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth received an excellent education at the hands of various tutors, including the great scholars of the day. She was an outstanding student, and could speak five languages fluently. [PARAGRAPH:2]When King Henry VIII died, the throne passed to his young son, Edward. At fifteen Elizabeth was implicated in a plot to overthrow him. She came close to being executed, surviving only because she was able to convince her skeptical interrogators that she knew nothing of the plot. [PARAGRAPH:2]When King Edward died in 1553, Elizabeth's older sister, Mary, assumed the throne. An ardent Catholic, Mary was quite unpopular with a number of Protestant noblemen, who attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow her in 1554. Once again Elizabeth was implicated, but once again she talked her way out of execution. [PARAGRAPH:2]Queen Mary died in 1558, and Elizabeth became Queen. Elizabeth was an extraordinary ruler. She established the Protestant Church as the official Church of England. However, she attempted to stem the persecution of Catholics in the country - at least as much as was possible when the Catholic nobility were actively plotting her demise. She restored the debased currency of England, and she made England a center of culture, where great artists like William Shakespeare flourished. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth used all of the tools available to her to achieve her goals. She received countless offers of marriage from nobility and indeed from kings across Europe. But she accepted none of them, instead using her unmarried state to control her friends and foes alike; if one faction got too strong, she could drive them back into line by suggesting that she was considering marrying someone from an opposing faction. [PARAGRAPH:2]Militarily, Catholic Spain was England's greatest threat. Spain was the great continental power of the day, and its leader, King Philip, had upon more than one occasion expressed the intent of invading England. In 1588 he tried, building a huge armada to conquer the upstart nation. Elizabeth quickly organized the country's navy to fend off the fleet, and by a combination of superior tactics, ship design, and some foul weather at just the right moment, they defeated the Spanish foe. England was not to be seriously threatened with invasion for about 400 years. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth died in 1603, having left her country in far better state. No better words can serve to describe her than her own: "I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king."</English>

    <English>[H1]Frederick[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Prussia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] January 24, 1712 - August 17, 1786 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Frederick was born to Frederick William I, the tyrannical and cultured King of Prussia. The king held his son in great contempt, despising him for his lack of interest in leadership and war; the younger Frederick instead preferred to study literature and the arts. At the age of 18 Frederick attempted to flee to England, but he was captured and brought back to his extremely angry father, who forced him to watch the beheading of his close friend and accomplice, Lieutenant Katz. He apparently was able to get back into his father's good graces, and several years later he married a German noblewoman at his father's request. [PARAGRAPH:2]For the next several years Frederick enjoyed the life of a wealthy man of letters. He maintained an active correspondence with various scholars from around Europe, including the brilliant French writer; Voltaire. He wrote "Anti-Machiavel," a lively refutation of Machiavelli's; "The Prince." Frederick assumed the throne of Prussia upon his father's death in 1740. [PARAGRAPH:2]Once in power, Frederick showed himself to be both a ruthless pragmatist and a brilliant campaigner. Seeking to increase the size of his empire, over the next 23 years he fought a series of wars against his neighbors, notably Austria, who was often allied with Russia and France. With the support of England he won a series of significant battles against his foes, but he was eventually worn down and soundly defeated, and Berlin was occupied by an allied Austrian-Russian army. [PARAGRAPH:2]Reportedly on the verge of suicide, Frederick was saved by the timely death of the Russian Tsarina, who was replaced by the pro-Prussian Peter III. Facing the combined power of Russia and Prussia, Austria was forced to accede to Frederick's demands and give up all claims to Upper and Lower Silesia. The two European monarchs then dismembered Poland, making Prussia the most powerful force in Europe for many years to come. [PARAGRAPH:2]Domestically, Frederick was the model of an "enlightened despot." He instituted important legal and penal reforms, created new industries, improved education, and accomplished internal improvements such as drainage projects, roads, and canals. He improved the lot of his own serfs (but did nothing to curtail the nobility's power over them). [PARAGRAPH:2]During his rule Frederick maintained his friendship with the enlightened men of Europe. His midnight soirees in Potsdam were famous for the great men they attracted. Frederick was quite famous for his sharp wit and caustic tongue; he more than held his own in their company. [PARAGRAPH:2]Frederick died in 1786, leaving Prussia more powerful and prosperous than when he first gained power. Upon his death, Frederick's nephew Frederick William II inherited the throne of Prussia.</English>

    <English>[H1]彼得大帝[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]俄罗斯皇帝[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生于1672年6月9日至公元1725年2月8日[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB Peter出生于沙皇亚历克赛一世的第四个儿子。在他父亲和哥哥去世后，10岁时，他与病重的同父异母兄弟伊万在姐妹索菲亚・阿列克谢夫娜（Sophia Alexeevna）的摄政下共同成为沙皇。显然彼得在他十几岁的时候是个恐怖分子。他完全蔑视宗教和政治仪式，加上几乎无限的精力和酗酒的能力。17岁时，他以密谋反对他的罪名逮捕了摄政王（他的姐姐），并将她锁在修道院，她将在那里度过余生。他完全控制了帝国，他的兄弟伊万不过是个傀儡。除了喝酒、狂欢和政治阴谋，年轻的彼得还对军事事务着迷。1695年，他命令军队进攻土耳其人。令人惊讶的是，他没有在战场上指挥他的部队，而是选择了一个卑微的炮兵。俄罗斯军队取得了胜利，不到一年就占领了重要的亚速尔港。几年后，彼得开始了欧洲之旅。他花了16个月的时间隐姓埋名地穿越德国、荷兰、英国和奥地利，曾在英国和荷兰做过造船工。彼得在旅行中学到了很多东西，后来他雇佣了许多西方工匠、工程师、士兵、水手、建筑师和艺术家帮助俄罗斯实现现代化。回到家后，彼得采纳了许多欧洲习俗，包括在法庭上剃胡子的规定，这是一场巨大的争议，几乎引起了博雅人的反抗。[PARAGRAPH:2]尽管彼得热爱欧洲文化，但他仍然是一个酗酒、专横的恶霸，他的恶作剧几乎完全停止了折磨。外国观察家惊恐地注意到，在一次国宴上，彼得让他的一个密友紧紧地抱着另一个密友，抱住他的胳膊，强迫他张开嘴。受害者痛恨沙拉，尤其是醋；彼得把沙拉塞进嘴里，塞进喉咙，然后往鼻子里倒醋，直到流了血。彼得喜欢强迫他的客人――包括外国外交官――喝酒直到昏倒，然后在一小时后叫醒他们，强迫他们多喝水。他曾在午夜唤醒一群醉酒的人，给他们斧头，要求他们帮助他砍伐树木，走到海边的路。1700年，俄国与瑞典开战。但事实证明，瑞典国王古斯塔夫斯・阿尔多尔福斯（Gustavus Aldolphus）更加狡猾，在彼得的军队准备就绪之前就袭击了它，并在这一过程中俘获了大部分俄罗斯大炮。作为回应，彼得要求莫斯科所有的钟声（包括教堂的钟声）都被熔化以制造大炮。他还没收了教堂的财宝，为战争加油。战争持续了很久，但在1709年，瑞典军队被决定性地击败，俄罗斯获得了芬兰、爱沙尼亚和拉脱维亚的部分领土。彼得的家庭生活并不特别顺利。1698年，他的妻子卷入了推翻他的阴谋；他和她离婚，把她送到另一所修道院。1712年，他与他的情妇玛莎・斯卡夫朗斯基结婚，玛莎是前立陶宛仆人，曾是其他俄罗斯贵族的情妇。她给了他四个孩子。1718年，沙皇的长子阿列克谢因涉嫌叛国而被监禁，并在酷刑下死亡。彼得死后被埋葬在圣彼得堡，这是他于1703年在彼得和保罗大教堂建立的重要港口和俄罗斯首都。大概是在他们能找到的最重的岩石下面。</English>

    <Chinese>[H1]Peter the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 9, 1672 - February 8, 1725 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Peter was born the fourth son of the Tsar Alexey I. After the death of his father and older brother, at the age of 10 he became co-tsar with his sickly half-brother, Ivan, under the regency of their sister Sophia Alexeevna. Apparently Peter was quite the terror in his teens. He had utter contempt for religious and political ceremony, combined with almost limitless energy and a capacity for alcohol. At 17 he had the regent (his elder sister) arrested on charges of conspiring against him and had her locked in a convent, where she would stay for the rest of her life. He took total control of the empire, his brother Ivan no more than a figurehead. [PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to drinking, carousing, and political intrigue, young Peter was also fascinated by military affairs. In 1695, he ordered the army to move against the Turks. Astonishingly, he didn't command his forces in the field, instead choosing to act as an lowly artilleryman. The Russian forces emerged victorious and within a year had captured the vital port of Azov. [PARAGRAPH:2]Several years later, Peter set off on a tour of Europe. He spent 16 months traveling incognito through Germany, Holland, England and Austria, at one time working as a shipwright in England and Holland. Peter learned a lot during his trip, and he later hired many western craftsmen, engineers, soldiers, sailors, architects and artists to help modernize Russia. Once home, Peter adopted many European customs, including a mandate that beards were to be shaved off at court, which was a great controversy that nearly caused a revolt with the Boyars. [PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his love of European culture, Peter remained a drunken, overbearing bully, whose practical jokes stopped just short of outright torture. (Or perhaps went a little over the line.) Foreign observers noted with horror that at a state dinner Peter had one of his cronies hold another tight, pinning his arms and forcing his mouth open. The victim was known to hate salads and especially vinegar; Peter jammed salad into his mouth and down his throat and then poured vinegar up his nose until it bled. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter liked to force his guests - including foreign diplomats - to drink until they passed out, then wake them up an hour later and force them to drink more. He once woke a group of extremely inebriated men up in the middle of the night, gave them axes and demanded that they help him cut down trees to make a path to the seashore. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1700 Russia went to war against Sweden. But, Gustavus Aldolphus, the Swedish King, proved more cunning to him, striking Peter's army before it was prepared, capturing much of the Russian artillery in the process. In response Peter demanded that all of the bells in Moscow (including church bells) be melted down to make cannons. He also confiscated church treasure to fuel the war effort. The war dragged on, but in 1709 the Swedish forces were decisively defeated, and Russia gained parts of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter's home life did not go particularly well. In 1698 his wife was implicated in a plot to overthrow him; he divorced her and sent her off to yet another convent. In 1712 he married his mistress, Martha Skavronsky, a former Lithuanian servant and previously the mistress of a bevey of other Russian nobles. She gave him four children. In 1718 the tsar's oldest son Alexey was imprisoned for suspected treason and died under torture. [PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his death Peter was buried in Saint Petersburg, the vital port and Russian capital, which he established in 1703, in the Peter and Paul Cathedral. Presumably under the heaviest rock they could find.</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]Catherine the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tsarina of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 2, 1729 - November 17, 1796 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Catherine was born in Szczecin in 1729, a princess of Pomerania, a small kingdom in Prussia. At 16 she was married to Carl Peter Ulrich, the heir to the Russian throne. Catherine quickly learned Russian and joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Largely self-educated, Catherine immersed herself in the literature of the time. Endowed with both beauty and intelligence, she became strong friends (if not more) with the great thinkers of the day, including the brilliant French philosophers Rousseau and Diderot.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine did not lack political ambition, however. At the age of 33, with the support of the Imperial guard, she overthrew her husband, the Emperor Peter III, who was soon killed "in a hunting accident," leaving Catherine the sole ruler of Russia. As Empress, Catherine pursued an expansionist policy, fighting two successful wars against the Ottoman Empire and acquiring vast territory in southern Ukraine and the Crimea. She undertook a wide range of political reforms, attempting to shape up the notoriously corrupt and incompetent Russian bureaucracy. She curried favor with the aristocracy, expanding their already-great power over the Russian peasants.[PARAGRAPH:2]A patron of the arts, Catherine commissioned many statues and paintings. Under her rule St. Petersburg was transformed from a primitive and forbidding city into one of the most beautiful and impressive European capitals.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite her many public successes, Catherine is best known for her private excesses. Her affairs are legendary; it has been suggested that she slept with a fairly large fraction of the Russian officers corps, not to mention her many well-publicized dalliances with a horde of well-known European politicians and artists.[NEWLINE]Catherine died at the age of 67, having lived longer than any other Romanov monarch. </English>

    <English>[H1]Isabella [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Spain[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] April 22, 1451 - November 26, 1504 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Isabella was the daughter of King John II of Castile. At the time of her birth, Spain was divided into a number of smaller kingdoms, with Castile, Portugal and Aragon being three of the largest. The southern part of the country was under Arab rule, the "Moors" having conquered much of Spain in the 8th Century. For Christian Spain, there were two major objectives: unite the country and drive out the Moors. Isabella accomplished both. [PARAGRAPH:2]After her father's death, Castile was ruled by Isabella's older brother, King Henry IV. At eighteen, and against her brother's express wishes, Isabella married Prince Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Aragon. Henry was furious at her - he had wanted her to marry the King of Portugal - but eventually he forgave her and made Isabella his heir. Upon his death in 1474, Isabella became Queen of Castile, and, after a brief war, made an alliance with Portugal, thus uniting much of Spain. [PARAGRAPH:2]Isabella and Ferdinand worked surprisingly well together. They co-ruled their two kingdoms equally (according to many historians, Isabella was the better ruler of the two). [PARAGRAPH:2]Once they were enthroned, the couple set about weakening the Spanish nobility, which Isabella believed had become overly powerful. They created a special military force known as the "Holy Brotherhood" for the express purpose of protecting people and property from attacks by the nobility. They also redistributed some of the nobles' lands and destroyed several of their castles. In other internal matters, Isabella and Ferdinand reorganized the courts and the justice system, and they more closely regulated the country's coinage. [PARAGRAPH:2]Some of Isabella and Ferdinand's other programs were less appealing. The two rulers were Catholic zealots and they had a rabid hatred for non-Catholics, and especially for Jews. In 1478 they petitioned the Pope to establish the Spanish Inquisition. Under Chief Inquisitor Torquemada, the Inquisition tortured and murdered thousands across Spain, driving the heretics out of the country or underground, or forcing them to convert to Catholicism. [PARAGRAPH:2]Interestingly, when they conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, Isabella and Ferdinand treated those Muslims quite well, allowing them to freely practice their religion in Spain. The Jews of Granada, however, were treated as barbarously as their cousins in other parts of Spain. [PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps Isabella's most famous act as monarch was her decision to fund Columbus's voyages of exploration. Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator who was looking for a western route to India; after getting Isabella's backing, he set out to cross the Atlantic to find Asia. Instead, Columbus discovered America. [PARAGRAPH:2]As a ruler, her record is mixed. She did unite her country along with the help of her husband, Ferdinand. She did drive out foreign powers who had occupied Spain for 700 years. She did bring peace and stability to Spain. She did fund exploration which would bring vast new territory and vast wealth to her kingdom. On the other hand, she did launch a terrible campaign of torture and murder against the most vulnerable population in her lands. To her Christian subjects, then, Isabella probably was the best thing that had ever come their way. However her Jewish subjects probably had a somewhat less positive opinion of Her Majesty. Isabella died in 1504, leaving the kingdom to her daughter.</English>

Arguably the first nation to discover America, under Joao's reign Portugal made several other important discoveries while also advancing the field of nautical navigation.[PARAGRAPH:2]"I am the lord of lords, not the server of servants." These words, originally a castigation of rebellious nobles by Joao, would come to define the Portuguese king's reign. Joao's dislike of court intrigue and the inability for political opinion to influence his decisions made him an unpopular king amongst his peers. The King's early rule was defined by his efforts to curtail, and eventually crush, all internal corruption and opposition to his rule. After having intercepted conspiratorial letters between the Duke of Braganza and Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1483, Joao had the Duke executed, his family banished from Portugal, and his lands and wealth confiscated. [PARAGRAPH:2]Joao II's policies focused primarily on the exploration and exploitation of maritime trade routes, particularly with India. The full extent of Portugal's explorations and discoveries remain largely unknown due to the government's secrecy, born of a fierce competition with its neighbor Castile. It is, however, argued that Portugal had already reached North America and Brazil by 1470 and 1480, respectively. This places their discovery of North America in advance of Christopher Columbus's voyage.[PARAGRAPH:2]Portugal, under the reign of Joao, was also credited with the 1484 discovery of the Congo River, the 1488 rounding of the Cape of Good Hope (Africa's southern tip), and the 1493 settlement of the So Tom?and Prncipe Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Disputes over rights of exploration between Castile and Aragon and Portugal would eventually lead to the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) which split the world in half. Portugal would be responsible for exploring the Eastern hemisphere while Aragon and Castile would have the Western hemisphere.[PARAGRAPH:2]Towards the end of his reign, Joao's only legitimate heir, Alfonso, died under mysterious circumstances. This prevented Portugal from inheriting ownership of Castile and Aragon through Alfonso's marriage to Isabella of Aragon - Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon's eldest daughter. Joao II died without male heir in 1495, possibly poisoned by the vengeful Portuguese nobility and was succeeded by his first cousin, Manuel I.</English>

    <English>[H1]Willem van Oranje[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of Holland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] April 24, 1533 - July 10, 1584 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Willem van Oranje, also known as "William the Silent," was born in 1533 into the House of Nassau, a prominent noble family in what is today modern Germany. In 1544, the young Count of Nassau, but 11 years old, became the Prince of Orange through an inheritance, with new holdings in the Netherlands waiting for young Willem to come of age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje was raised in the lap of luxury, his family a favorite of the Spanish monarch in control of the Netherlands, Charles V. Oranje received his education in France at the behest of the Spanish King and proved to be both a precocious student and a charismatic leader. With the completion of his education, Oranje took control of his estates in the Netherlands. Thanks in part to his calm demeanor, which was a welcome change during an age of rising tensions, Oranje was appointed to a number of important posts within the Dutch government, eventually reaching the position of stadtholder, the highest rank open to a Dutchman. His selection to this auspicious rank came thanks to Phillip II, Charles' son and the new King.[PARAGRAPH:2]By 1559, enforcement of the law of Placaten, which made Protestantism not only a religious crime, but a civil one as well, increased bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics throughout the Netherlands. Oranje, taking a stance against the persecution of Protestants in the Netherlands, gradually found himself on the wrong side of the Catholic Spanish monarchs. Catching word of an imminent assassination attempt, Oranje was forced to retreat to his castle in Nassau, hoping to keep himself alive and free of the growing Dutch rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Phillip II sent Fernando de Toledo, the Duke of Alva, to deal with the uprising and arrest its leaders, Oranje was included in the list of outlaws. After failing to defeat Alva with his meager army, Oranje again fled, fortifying himself in the states of Holland. The Prince of Oranje, universally recognized for his ability and cunning, now found himself embroiled in the heart of the sweeping Dutch rebellion, which would continue to grow in size and scope into what became known as the Eighty Years' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to sudden changes in Spanish leadership within the region, a number of provinces, taking advantage of the ensuing havoc, allied themselves with Oranje and the rebellion. With the signing of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, the five northern provinces of the Netherlands, along with much of Flanders and Brabant, previously separate, united in their opposition to Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]To support the insufficient Dutch forces, Oranje had sought foreign aid and in 1581 received word from Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother of the French king, that if the struggling provinces declared independence from Spain and appointed Francis their sovereign, he would aid them in defeating their Spanish foe. So, on July 26, 1581, the United Provinces declared their independence from Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje, unfortunately, was unable to enjoy his country's new independence for long. Unhappy with the restrictions the Dutch nobles had placed on his powers, the Duke of Anjou turned against Oranje and his peers. And while Anjou was defeated not long after, an assassin hired by King Phillip gunned down Willem van Oranje in 1584, bringing to an end the leader's grand struggle for Dutch freedom.[PARAGRAPH:2]While Oranje had passed on, the want for an independent Netherlands did not. Struggles would continue with the Spanish, but in 1648, the Treaty of Westphalia would end the Eighty Years' War and finally grant the country the self-determination that Willem van Oranje had died trying to institute.</English>

    <English>[H1]Mehmed II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan of the Ottoman Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] March 30, 1432 - May 3, 1481 CE[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mehmed II, also known as el-Fatih ("the Conqueror") was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1451 - 1481 AD. He is best known for capturing the city of Constantinople, turning it into the new Ottoman capital and destroying the Byzantine Empire in the process. Mehmed was born in Edirne, which was then the capital of the Ottoman state, in 1432. He was fascinated by military matters from an early age; by the time that he reached maturity and ascended to the position of sultan (in 1451), Mehmed was prepared to begin the attack upon the city of Constantinople. [PARAGRAPH:2]During the thousand-year history of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople had withstood sieges many times. It had only been captured once, by the Fourth Crusaders in 1204. But by the fifteenth century the Byzantine Empire was a battered shell of its former self: while it still held Constantinople, it retained only a few small territories outside the city's walls (mainly in Greece). [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed began the siege by constructing a pair of fortresses on both sides of the straights surrounding the city, thus preventing reinforcement by sea. When Mehmed attacked in 1453, the Byzantines were horribly outnumbered: there were only 7000 defenders to meet an army of roughly 100,000 Turks. Help was not forthcoming from the West, which remained hostile to the Byzantines because of the split between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. [PARAGRAPH:2]Using enormous primitive cannon, the Ottomans battered the walls of Constantinople for weeks (although the rate of fire was so slow that the defenders were able to repair much of the damage as it took place). On May 29 Mehmed finally ordered an assault at a damaged section of the walls. The assault was successful, and the attackers succeeded in breaking into the city streets. The city's fate was sealed. The last Emperor, Constantine XI, died in battle, and the ancient empire was extinguished forever. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed gave his soldiers a day to loot the city (which was a customary practice at the time), during which a large portion of the populace was slaughtered, raped, or enslaved. After his soldiers' greed and lust were sated, Mehmed made every effort to rebuild the city and repopulate it with Turks. (Despite this odious "ethnic cleansing" at the beginning of his reign, Mehmed generally treated his non-Islamic subjects well, granting them permission to practice their religion freely, as well as a great deal of local autonomy.) The Byzantine administration was largely preserved intact and was given the task of running the Ottoman Empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Upon consolidating his control over Constantinople, Mehmed finished off the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire by conquering some small states in Greece and in 1461 he conquered the tiny Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea. He then tried to extend his empire into Europe, but in 1462 he was defeated by Prince Vlad III (the real Count Dracula) of Wallachia, and at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475 he suffered a major loss to the Moldavian Prince Stefan. These defeats put an end to that campaign. However, Mehmed still had ambition - and plenty of it. [PARAGRAPH:2]Believing that his conquest of Rome made him the legitimate ruler of the late Roman Empire, at the end of his life Mehmed embarked on an ambitious but foolhardy campaign to reunite his divided empire. The campaign began well; the Ottomans invaded Italy, and in 1840 the city of Otranto was easily captured. However, a rebellion in Albania the same year threatened the Ottoman supply lines, forcing the Ottomans to divide their forces. The following year a large Christian army led by the pope pushed the Ottomans from Italy. Mehmed died in 1481, putting an end forever to his dream of recapturing the ancient glory of Rome. [PARAGRAPH:2]In large, history has judged Mehmed kindly. He is recognized for his military success and his strong rule, and later Ottoman sultans would seek to follow his example. Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople was one of the most important events in Western history, signifying the end of the medieval period. His attack upon Italy may have been foolish, but it ultimately did little to harm the young Ottoman Empire that was his legacy.</English>

    <Chinese>[H1]Mehmed II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]奥斯曼帝国苏丹[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生活于公元1432年3月30日至1481年5月3日[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB TAB]Mehmed II，也称为el Fatih（“征服者”）公元1451-1481年是奥斯曼帝国的苏丹。他以占领君士坦丁堡城、将其变成新的奥斯曼首都并在此过程中摧毁拜占庭帝国而闻名。1432年，穆罕默德出生在当时是奥斯曼帝国首都的埃迪尔内。他从小就对军事事务着迷；当迈赫迈德成熟并升任苏丹时（1451年），他准备开始进攻君士坦丁堡。在拜占庭帝国的千年历史中，君士坦丁堡经受了多次围困。它只被第四十字军在1204年俘虏过一次。但到了15世纪，拜占庭帝国已经是一个破败的躯壳：虽然它仍然拥有君士坦丁堡，但它只保留了城外的一些小领土（主要在希腊）。[PARAGRAPH:2]迈赫迈德在包围城市的直道两侧修建了一对堡垒，从而阻止了海上增援。当迈赫迈德在1453年发动进攻时，拜占庭人的数量远远超过了他们：只有7000名守卫者与大约100000名土耳其人的军队作战。西方没有提供帮助，因为天主教和东正教的分裂，西方对拜占庭仍然怀有敌意。[PARAGRAPH:2]奥斯曼帝国使用巨大的原始大炮，连续数周击打君士坦丁堡的城墙（尽管射速如此缓慢，以至于防御者能够在发生时修复大部分损坏）。5月29日，迈赫迈德最终下令对一段受损的城墙发起攻击。袭击成功，袭击者成功闯入城市街道。这座城市的命运注定了。最后一位君主君士坦丁席在战斗中牺牲，古帝国永远灭亡。[PARAGRAPH:2]穆罕默德给他的士兵一天时间洗劫这座城市（这是当时的惯例），在此期间，大部分民众被屠杀、强奸或奴役。在他的士兵们的贪婪和欲望得到满足后，穆罕默德竭尽全力重建这座城市，并让土耳其人重新定居。（尽管在他统治初期出现了这种令人发指的“种族清洗”，但穆罕默德总体上对他的非伊斯兰臣民很好，允许他们自由地信奉自己的宗教，并给予了大量的地方自治权。）拜占庭行政当局基本上完好无损，并被赋予管理奥斯曼帝国的任务。[PARAGRAPH:2]在巩固对君士坦丁堡的控制后，穆罕默德征服了希腊的一些小国，结束了拜占庭帝国的最后残余，并于1461年征服了黑海上的小帝国特雷比松。然后，他试图将他的帝国扩展到欧洲，但在1462年，他被瓦拉基亚的弗拉德三世王子（真正的德古拉伯爵）击败，并在1475年的瓦斯吕战役中，他遭受了摩尔多瓦王子斯特凡的重大损失。这些失败结束了那场战役。然而，迈赫迈德仍然有雄心壮志――而且有很多雄心壮志。迈赫迈德相信他征服罗马使他成为罗马帝国晚期的合法统治者，在他生命的最后，他开始了一场雄心勃勃但鲁莽的运动，以重新统一他分裂的帝国。运动开始得很好；奥斯曼帝国入侵意大利，1840年奥特兰托城很容易被攻占。然而，同年阿尔巴尼亚的一次叛乱威胁到了奥斯曼帝国的补给线，迫使奥斯曼帝国分裂军队。第二年，教皇领导的一支庞大的基督教军队将奥斯曼帝国赶出意大利。穆罕默德于1481年去世，从此永远结束了他夺回古罗马辉煌的梦想。总的来说，历史对穆罕默德的评价是仁慈的。他因军事上的成功和强大的统治而受到认可，后来的奥斯曼苏丹会寻求效仿他的榜样。穆罕默德征服君士坦丁堡是西方历史上最重要的事件之一，标志着中世纪的结束。他对意大利的攻击可能是愚蠢的，但最终对他留下的年轻的奥斯曼帝国几乎没有任何伤害。</Chinese>

Suleiman's conquests reached from Baghdad to Egypt, making the Ottoman Empire the main channel through which the riches of the east could reach Europe. Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean further aided Suleiman's economic empire, the corsair Barbarossa sending innumerable European ships to the sea floor.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was this penchant for expansionism that struck fear into the heart of Europe. The Sultan's push northward took him as far as Hungary, where he found his progress stalled by the Hapsburg ruler Archduke Ferdinand I.[PARAGRAPH:2]While his territorial accomplishments were impressive, the Sultan did not ignore the culture of his homeland, Suleiman himself a skilled poet and fervent Muslim. Towards the end of his reign, Suleiman commissioned numerous new mosques of a previously unseen grandeur, designed by master architect, Sinan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suleiman became well known in both the Christian west and the Muslim east, but for strikingly different reasons. Most Europeans envied the Sultan for the sheer opulence in which he lived. Celebrations of a previously unheard of grandeur were held at the Hippodrome in Istanbul. Rooms covered in gold, gems and the finest tapestries could be seen throughout the Sultan's palace at Topkapi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Muslims, on the other hand, respected the Sultan for his belief in the rule of law. The Sultan adopted Islamic sacred law to compliment the traditional law already in place from his predecessors. Both Christian and Muslim recognized the renewed strength and sense of honor that Suleiman brought to the Ottoman Empire, deeming him worthy of the title "The Magnificent."</English>

    <English>[H1]Maria Theresa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Archduchess of Austria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 13, 1717 - November 29, 1780 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Maria Theresa was the eldest daughter of Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel and Emperor Charles VI who allowed her to succeed the Habsburg Monarchy. Her transition to the throne was all but simple. Opposition to her succession to the throne led to the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. After Emperor Charles VII, who claimed the throne, died in 1745, Maria Theresa claimed the throne for her husband, Francis I. She was technically the empress consort, but was the de facto ruler of the nation. In 1745, she also began styling herself as the Holy Roman Empress.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria Theresa helped commence financial and educational reforms, promoted commerce, agriculture, and reorganized the army. Many of her actions strengthened Austria as a whole and its resources. After a continuous conflict with Prussia, the Seven Years' War and eventually to the War of the Bavarian Succession. She became the dowager empress after the death of Francis and succession of her son Joseph as emperor in 1765. Maria Theresa brought unity to the Habsburg Monarchy and is considered one of its most talented rulers.[PARAGRAPH:2]While Bavaria and France posed a continuous threat to Austria, it was Frederick the Great who became Maria's primary foe during her reign. Maria Theresa focused the majority of her policies towards the defeat or Prussia. Because of these reforms, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave the Austrian Netherlands back to Maria Theresa. In exchange, Maria ceded Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla to the Infante Philip of Spain. After being defeated in the First and Second Silesian Wars, Maria Theresa began to modernize her realms with the assistance of Freidrich Wilhelm Graf von Gaugwitz. Of her many reforms, she increased the size of the army by 200% and increased taxes to guarantee a steady income for the military. She also centralized the government by combining the Austrian and Bohemian chancelleries into one administrative office.[PARAGRAPH:2]Like other Habsburgs, Maria Theresa was a devout Roman Catholic. She was educated by Jesuits at Mariazell, and in later life was short of the religious pessimism of other royal figures of her time. Her conservative outlook involved a poor view of other faiths. In 1741, she expelled the Jewish people from Prague.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria Theresa dropped Great Britain as an ally and allied herself with Russia and France. When she felt her army was strong enough, she prepared an attack on Prussia in 1756. However, it was Frederick II who attacked first, invading Saxony and starting the Seven Years' War. When Maria Theresa signed the Treaty of Hubertsburg in 1763, the war ended recognizing Prussia as the owner of most of Silesia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After her husband's death in 1765, Maria Theresa became separated from her people. Her focus changed to maintaining peace, rather than regaining Silesia. She named her son, Joseph II, as coregent and Emperor. However, he received limited powers because she felt he was too haughty for the full responsibilities. In 1767, Maria Theresa was infected with smallpox. However, she recovered and became a strong supporter of inoculation. In her later years, she focused on reforming laws along the lines of enlightened absolutism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1771, she and Joseph II issued to Robot Patent, a reform that regulated the serf's payments in her lands. Other reforms included outlawing witch-burning and torture, and taking capital punishment the off the penal code. In 1772, Maria Theresa founded the Imperial and Royal Academy of Science and Literature in Brussels. Mandatory education was introduced in 1774 in order to form an educated class of citizens, from which civil servants were recruited. Maria Theresa continued issuing various police laws throughout Austria. She died in 1780 in Vienna, being the only female to rule the Habsburg Dynasty, which lasted 650 years. Her son Joseph II was her successor.</English>

Philip would rule the Duchy until his death.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 19 June 1369, Philip married the 19 year old Margaret of Dampierre, the daughter of Louis II, Count of Flanders, who would become the heiress of Flanders, Brabant, Artois, and the Free County of Burgundy after the death of her brother in 1376. Margaret was the widow of his stepbrother, Philip of Rouvres, Duke of Burgundy, Count Palatine of Burgundy, and Count of Artois, Boulogne and Auvergne, who had died childless in 1361. As her father's eventual heiress, Margaret would bring rich possessions to her husband and to their children.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip was very active in the court of France, particularly after the death of his brother, Charles V, who left the 12 year old Charles VI as King. Charles was a minor, so a regency was undertaken by his uncles, Louis, Duke of Anjou, John, Duke of Berry, Philip himself, and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, Charles VI's maternal uncle. The regency lasted until 1388, Philip taking the dominant role before the Marmousets were appointed as personnal advisors of Charles VI.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1392 though, the king of France wasn't able to rule the kingdom because of his insanity and Philip was the principal ruler of France until 1402.</English>

She asserted that she had visions from God which told her to recover her homeland from English domination late in the Hundred Years' War. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent her to the siege at Orlans as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence when she overcame the light regard of veteran commanders and lifted the siege in only nine days. Several more swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims and settled the disputed succession to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]The renewed French confidence outlasted her own brief career. She refused to leave the field when she was wounded during an attempt to recapture Paris that autumn. Hampered by court intrigues, she led only minor companies from then onward and fell prisoner at a skirmish near Compiegne the following spring.[PARAGRAPH:2]A politically motivated trial convicted her of heresy. The English regent John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford had her burnt at the stake in Rouen. She had been the heroine of her country at the age of seventeen and died at just nineteen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some twenty-four years later Pope Callixtus III reopened the case and a new finding overturned the original conviction.

Accounts of this meeting vary greatly. All agree that during the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and Abu Bakr became the first Muslim caliph, who was given the title, Khalifa-tul-Rasool (Successor of messenger of Allah), a title only accepted by Sunni muslims.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the meeting at saqifah, the Muslims who were not present were asked to submit to Abu Bakr, to give their pledge of allegiance.

Simeon was born to a Christianized Bulgaria due to his father's reign. In his early years, Simeon learned the Greek language and received a theological education in Constantinople. Although Simeon's brother Vladimir was the designated heir of Boris, he was deposed after attempting to reintroduce paganism to Bulgaria and Simeon became king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, the Bulgarian marketplace was moved from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The merchants then required protection from Simeon, who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 894. However, the Bulgarian army was required back in the country after a Magyar invasion from the north. Later, the Magyars were convinced by the Byzantines to attack Bulgaria. Simeon, being unaware of this agreement, met another force of Byzantines from Italy. After agreeing to peace with the Byzantine commander, Simeon blocked off the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube. Simeon, after hearing of the Magyar attack, moved to confront them. The Magyars defeated Bulgaria and later pillaged its land, and Simeon agreed to peace with Byzantium in 895.[PARAGRAPH:2]Now that the Byzantine threat was abolished, Simeon planned a campaign against the Magyars. Simeon defeated the Magyars and expanded Bulgarian territory. Simeon then defeated a Byzantine army after a dispute about Bulgarian prisoners in Thrace. The war ended and Byzantium was required to pay an annual tribute and cede lands to Bulgaria. However, Simeon often violated these treaties, conquering and attacking Byzantine territory on several occasions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Leo VI's death paved the way for another Bulgarian invasion of Byzantium. Simeon was recognized as Emperor of the Bulgarians after negotiations with the Byzantines. In 917, the Byzantines planned a campaign against eh Bulgarians. In the Battle of Anchialos, one of the largest medieval battles in history, Simeon defeated the Byzantines. In order to cease Serbian unrest, Simeon removed the current Serbian ruler and replaced him with another, ensuring Bulgarian influence over Serbia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After another government change in Constantinople, Simeon declared war on Byzantium to further assert his power. He captured several Byzantine cities and requested the help of the Arabs. However, the Arabs accepted peace with the Byzantines, thus ruining their alliance with Bulgaria. Simeon was forced to establish peace with Byzantium after the threat of a Serbian uprising, where he deposed the Serbian ruler. In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, but were defeated by the army of King Tomislav. In the last years of his life, Simeon prepared for another siege of Constantinople. On May 27, 927, Simeon died of heart failure in his palace in Preslav and was succeeded by his son Peter I.</English>

He also ruled a vast empire in the Americas, including New Spain and Peru.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip's policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic self-interest. He found himself by default the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the Ottoman Turks and against the forces of the Protestant Reformation. He never relented from his war against heresy, preferring to fight on every front at whatever cost rather than countenance heterodoxy within his territories. These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where the Protestant heresy had taken deep root. Following the Revolt of the Netherlands in 1568, Philip waged a long war for control of the Netherlands, which dragged in the English and the French and lasted for the rest of his life. In 1588, the Spanish armada was destroyed by a tempest off the southern cost of Ireland, thus thwarting his planned invasion of England. Concerned with the Muslim threat in the Mediterranean, Philip achieved a decisive victory against the Turks at the Lepanto in 1571, where the fleet of the Holy League was commanded by his illegitimate brother John of Austria. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of Portugal in 1580.[PARAGRAPH:2]After basing himself in the Netherlands in the early years of his reign, Philip returned to the peninsula in 1559 and never left it again. Unlike his father, Charles V, Philip was thoroughly Spanish, a native speaker who chose to rule from Spain rather than to travel constantly around his states. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority. Spain was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the Crown of Castile. In practice, Philip often found his authority overruled by local assemblies, and his word was less authoritarian than British or French historians have always tried to characterize. The Kingdom of Aragon, where Philip was obliged to put down a rebellion in 1591?592, was particularly unruly. He also grappled with the intractable problem of the large Morisco population in Spain, persuaded to convert to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1568, a Morisco Revolt broke out in the southern province of Granada in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs, and Philip wisely decided the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite its immense dominions, Spain itself was an arid country with a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown. Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, the collection of which was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns not only by taxing the local resources of his empire, but also the flow of income from the New World proved vital to his militant foreign policy. His exchequer several times was able to avoid bankruptcy. Philip's reign saw an extraordinary flourishing of cultural excellence in Spain, part of what is called the Golden Age, creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts.</English>

    <English>[H1]Christian IV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Denmark and Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] April 12, 1577 - February 28, 1648 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]King of Denmark and Norway (1588-1648), who led two unsuccessful wars against Sweden and brought disaster upon his country by leading it into the Thirty Years' War. He energetically promoted trade and shipping, left a national heritage of fine buildings, and won repute as a plucky, hard-drinking man of grim wit and great resource.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian, the son of Frederick II of Denmark and Sophia of Mecklenburg, succeeded to the throne on the death of his father in 1588, but until his coronation in 1596 his country was governed by a regency of four members of the Rigsrad, the privy council, who also supervised his education. He was brought up as a Lutheran and studied Latin, French, Italian, and German as well as mathematics, navigation, drawing, military command, fencing, and dancing.[PARAGRAPH:2]After his coronation Christian succeeded in limiting the powers of the Rigsrad. He kept the most important offices vacant and surrounded himself with an entourage of aristocratic young officers and German officials drawn mainly from his dukedom of Holstein. The Rigsrad was opposed to a war against Sweden, but Christian threatened to declare war in his capacity as duke of Schleswig-Holstein, thus forcing the Rigsrad to sanction plans for a war (1611-13), with the aim of once more uniting Sweden with Denmark. Although Christian won the war, his victory remained essentially inconclusive.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the war Christian centred his efforts on the economic development of his kingdom; he founded new towns, particularly ports to strengthen defenses, enlarged the royal shipyards, and built beautiful buildings and castles in and around Copenhagen. When the Protestant cause in northern Germany was endangered, in 1624, Christian entered the Thirty Years' War, again in opposition to his councillors. His aims were to protect Danish interests in northern Germany, to stop the Swedish king from playing a role in European politics, and to take up the legacy of his father and grandfather as the leading member of the Lutheran Church and its defender against expanding Catholicism. In 1625 he began operations against the Catholic League in Germany led by Tilly, the Bavarian commander in chief, who defeated him at Lutter am Barenberge on Aug. 17, 1626. Tilly's and Wallenstein's troops next invaded and plundered Jutland, thus forcing Christian to form an alliance with the Swedish king Gustavus II Adolphus against the Catholics. After the Swedish-Danish army and fleet had forced Wallenstein to raise the siege of Stralsund, however, Christian severed the alliance and concluded a separate peace with the Holy Roman emperor at Lbeck in May 1629. Though Christian's prestige and even his faith in himself as a great captain were diminished, he had not lost any lands. After the war he continued to try to impede Swedish progress in northern Germany and to maintain his rights in the Baltic and the North Sea. He repeatedly raised the shipping tolls through The Sound into the Baltic in order to augment his income independently of the Rigsrad, but he thus alienated his old allies, the sea powers of England and the Netherlands. With the help of the Netherlands, Sweden attacked Denmark in December 1643; and, by the end of January 1644, Jutland was in their possession. Christian led the defense personally, blockading the Swedish ships for a time, and lost an eye in the naval battle of Kolberger Heide. Although this battle was inconclusive, the Danish fleet was later annihilated by the combined navies of Sweden and Holland, and Christian was compelled to conclude a humiliating peace in August 1645 that cost him possessions in the Baltic, Norway, and Scania. Throughout his reign the Rigsrad and the nobility had opposed his warlike policies and the ensuing strain on finances, and after this defeat even Christian's sons-in-law turned against him, forcing him to accept the increased power of the nobility. Though he died a bitter and broken man, Christian IV had ruled his kingdom for more than 50 years and is remembered as one of the most popular of Danish kings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian IV was inclined to occupy himself with every minor detail of his administration while losing sight of the larger problems. Not only did he personally lay down the lines of Denmark's mercantilistic policy, he even established the import duties; he started state-subsidized and privileged trading companies and manufacturies-all of them with no marked success-and insisted on auditing their accounts personally. He founded a new academy for young noblemen, provided funds for the students at the university and built them a new college, personally examined the knowledge of Latin and the religious orthodoxy of the clergymen due for promotion, made designs for new types of guns and tested them himself, inspected the contents of the new arsenals, acted as a judge even in minor cases, and tried out the new ships of his navy. Christian was a great builder and founder of cities. He founded the towns of Kristiania (now Oslo) and Kristiansand in Norway; Kristianstad and Kristianopel in what is now Sweden; Christianshavn in Denmark; and Glckstadt (which was to compete with Hamburg) in Holstein. Evidence of his unremitting industry are his more than 3,000 handwritten letters still preserved, written in an imaginative and vivid Danish prose and teeming with orders and questions on all subjects from the eternal laws of God to the brewing of stronger beer.</English>

    <English>[H1]Harald Hardrada[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1015 - September 25, 1066 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Harald was the king of Norway from 1047 until 1066. He was also claimed to be the King of Denmark until 1062, often defeating King Sweyn's army and forcing him to leave the country. Many details of his life were chronicled in the Heimskringla. Among English-speakers, he is generally known as "Harold Hardrada" and remembered for his invasion of England in 1066. The death of Hardrada is often recorded as the end of the Viking era.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born in 1015, Harald was the youngest of King Olaf II's three half-brothers born to Aasta Gudbrandsdatter. When Harald was 15, King Olaf was killed, trying to take the throne back from Canute the Great in 1030 at the Battle of Stiklestad. Harald took part in the battle and although wounded managed to escape and leave Norway in exile.[NEWLINE]He was able to form a band of warriors out of men who had also been exiled as a result of Olaf's death. In 1031 Harald and his men reached the land of the Kievan Rus where they served the armies of Yaroslav I the Wise, the Grand Prince of the Rus. Harald is thought to have taken part in Grand Prince Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles and was appointed joint commander of defense forces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some years after Harald and his men had entered the land of the Rus, they packed up and left for the heart of the Byzantine Empire, the city of Constantinople. At the time, the Byzantine Empire was the wealthiest empire in Medieval Europe and the Near East. Harald and his men pledged themselves to the service of the armies of the empire. Harald's forces joined the elite mercenary unit known as the Varangian Guard. It was not long until Harald had proven himself in battle and gained the respect of his fellow guardsmen. He soon became the leader of the entire force and used this power to undertake his own missions. Harald's forces won a great many victories in North Africa, Syria and Sicily. Through ingenuity, he and his men were able to besiege and defeat a number of castles. A contemporary source reports such tactics as attaching burning resin to birds, setting the castle ablaze, digging a tunnel and feigning reluctance to fight, only to launch an attack at the most advantageous moment. Harald was able to build a large fortune in plunder from his victories.[PARAGRAPH:2]Harald took part in the suppression of the uprising of Peter Delyan, who attempted to restore the Bulgarian Empire in 1040-1041. In the Norse sagas, he is hailed as "Devastator of Bulgaria" and "Scourge of the Bulgarians" due to his participation, and is even thought to have cut down Peter Delyan in the field of battle. Some authors go as far as to theorize that Harald named Oslo after a Bulgarian he fell in love with, possibly named Slava or Oslava, though these theories are not known to have any actual base.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to Snorri Sturluson, who quoted the skald Stuf, Harald also made a raid into the country of Palestine and was able to conquer the city of Jerusalem:[NEWLINE]"Here it is told that this land came without fire and sword under Harald's command. He then went out to Jordan and bathed therein, according to the custom of other pilgrims. Harald gave great gifts to our Lord's graves, to the Holy Cross, and other holy relics in the land of Jerusalem. He also cleared the whole road all the way out to Jordan, by killing the robbers and other disturbers of the peace."[PARAGRAPH:2]This story would have made Harald the forerunner of the Crusaders, whose kingdom was a century old at the time of Snorri Sturluson - a claim of obvious prestige valued to later Norwegian monarchs. In 1225, when the saga was written, Snorri was championing the cause of the Norwegian monarchy and urging a unification of Iceland with Norway. Byzantine and Islamic sources of Harald's own time do not mention such a conquest of Jerusalem. It is, however, quite plausible that as a Christian Harald did go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem with his men, and that they did fight and defeat robbers infesting the pilgrims' route to the Holy City - without intending or effecting the city's conquest from the Muslims.[PARAGRAPH:2]Using the wealth he had built during his service to the Byzantine Empire, Harald returned to Norway in 1045. He brought with him a number of men who served with him, and, as a result, became an immediate threat to the sitting king, Magnus I, who was the son of Olaf II and nephew of Harald and had returned from exile in 1035 to reclaim his father's throne after the death of Canute the Great.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sturluson writes: "When Harald returned to Constantinople from Jerusalem he longed to return to the North to his native land; and when he heard that Magnus Olafson, his brother's son, had become king both of Norway and Denmark, he gave up his command in the Greek service. And when the empress Zoe heard of this she became angry and raised an accusation against Harald that he had misapplied the property of the Greek emperor which he had received in the campaigns in which he was the commander of the army. On this account the Greek emperor had Harald made prisoner and carried to prison."[PARAGRAPH:2]When he finally returned to Norway, Magnus agreed to share power with his uncle Harald and the two became co-rulers. However, it was only a year later that Magnus would die. The circumstances surrounding his death were never truly explained. Speculation and increased tension between the two rulers led to the widespread belief that Magnus was killed by Harald so that he alone would control Norway.</English>

    <English>[H1]Enrico Dandolo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]41st Doge of Venice[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1107 - June 21, 1205 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Enrico Dandolo is remembered primarily for his role in the Fourth Crusade which ultimately conquered Constantinople and ended (for a time) the Byzantine Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]He became the 39th Doge of Venice on 1 January 1193, Dandolo was already old and blind, but deeply ambitious, and displayed tremendous mental and (for his age) physical strength. He was at least in his seventies when he became Doge. Some accounts say he was already 85 years old when he became Doge. His remarkable deeds over the next eleven years bring that age into question, however. Others have hypothesized that he may have been in his mid-70s when he became Venice's leader.In 1202 the knights of the Fourth Crusade were stranded in Venice, unable to pay for the ships they had commissioned after far fewer troops arrived than expected. Dandolo developed a plan that allowed the crusaders' debt to be suspended if they assisted the Venetians in restoring nearby Zara to Venetian control. At an emotional and rousing ceremony in San Marco di Venezia, Dandolo "took the cross" (committed himself to crusading) and was soon joined by thousands of other Venetians. Dandolo became an important leader of the crusade.[PARAGRAPH:2]Venice was the major financial backer of the Fourth Crusade, supplied the Crusaders' ships, and lent money to the Crusaders who became heavily indebted to Venice. Because of the crusaders' continued delays, provisions were also a problem for the enterprise.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although they were supposed to be sailing to Egypt, Dandolo convinced them to stop at Zara, a port city on the Adriatic that was claimed both by Venice and by the Kingdom of Hungary. Dandolo encouraged the crusaders to attack the city which had rebelled from Venice. A small number of Crusaders refused to help; but the others realized that the conquest of the rebel town and subsequent wintering there was the only way to hold the faltering crusade together. Zara was besieged and captured on November 15, 1202.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly afterwards, Alexius Angelus, son of the deposed Byzantine emperor Isaac II, arrived in that city. Dandolo agreed to go along with crusade leaders plan to place Alexius Angelus on the throne of the Byzantine Empire in return for Byzantine support of the crusade. This ultimately led to the conquest and sack of Constantinople on April 13, 1204, an event at which Dandolo was present and in which he played a directing role. The Catholic Crusaders then took permanent control of the Eastern Orthodox capital of Constantinople (or Byzantium) and established a Catholic state, the Latin Empire. Venice gained title to three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire as a result of the 4th Crusade. The Byzantine Empire was never again as powerful as it had been prior to the Fourth Crusade.</English>

     <Chinese>[H1]恩里科・丹多洛[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]威尼斯第41道[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生活在：[\BOLD]c。公元1107年至1205年6月21日[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]人们对恩里科・丹多洛的记忆主要是因为他在第四次十字军东征中所扮演的角色，最终征服了君士坦丁堡，结束了拜占庭帝国（一段时间）。[PARAGRAPH:2]他于1193年1月1日成为威尼斯的第39位总督，丹多洛已经年老失明，但他雄心勃勃，表现出巨大的精神和（就他这个年龄而言）体力。当他成为狗的时候，他至少七十多岁了。一些报道说，他成为多格时已经85岁了。然而，他在接下来的11年里的卓越事迹使这个年龄受到了质疑。其他人猜测，当他成为威尼斯的领袖时，他可能已经70多岁了。1202年，第四次十字军东征的骑士们被困在威尼斯，无法支付他们所委托的船只的费用，因为到达的军队远远少于预期。丹多洛制定了一项计划，如果十字军帮助威尼斯人将附近的扎拉恢复到威尼斯人的控制之下，就可以暂停十字军的债务。在威尼斯圣马可举行的激动人心的仪式上，丹多洛“接受了十字架”（致力于十字军东征），并很快与数千名其他威尼斯人会合。丹多洛成为十字军东征的重要领袖。[PARAGRAPH:2]威尼斯是第四次十字军东征的主要财政支持者，为十字军提供船只，并向十字军借钱，十字军因此负债累累。由于十字军的持续拖延，给养对企业号来说也是一个问题。[PARAGRAPH:2]虽然他们本应开往埃及，但丹多洛说服他们在亚得里亚海的港口城市扎拉停留，威尼斯和匈牙利王国都声称该港口城市拥有主权。丹多洛鼓励十字军进攻从威尼斯叛变而来的城市。少数十字军拒绝帮助；但其他人意识到，征服叛军城镇并随后在那里过冬是使步履蹒跚的十字军东征团结一致的唯一途径。扎拉于1202年11月15日被围困并被捕。[PARAGRAPH:2]不久之后，被废黜的拜占庭皇帝以撒二世的儿子亚历克赛・安杰卢斯（Alexius Angelus）抵达该城。丹多洛同意与十字军东征领导人一起计划让亚历克赛・安杰卢斯登上拜占庭帝国的宝座，以换取拜占庭对十字军东征的支持。这最终导致了1204年4月13日征服和洗劫君士坦丁堡，丹多洛出席了这一活动，并在其中担任导演。天主教十字军随后永久控制了东正教首都君士坦丁堡（或拜占庭），并建立了天主教国家拉丁帝国。由于第四次十字军东征，威尼斯获得了拜占庭帝国八分之三的土地。拜占庭帝国从未像第四次十字军东征之前那样强大。</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]Yaroslav I the Wise[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Grand Prince of Kievan Rus[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 978 - February 20, 1054 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Yaroslav I the Wise was thrice Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev, uniting the two principalities for a time under his rule. During his lengthy reign, Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural flowering and military power.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of his father Vladimir the Great, Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Boleslaw I Chrobry of Poland. During the course of this struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Svyatopolk of planning those murders, while the Saga of Eymund is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris's assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav.[PARAGRAPH:2]Leaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav's claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of his brothers, Nestor the Chronicler and later Russian historians often presented him as a model of virtue, styling him "the Wise". Yaroslav was a notable patron of book culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Russian monk Ilarion proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev, thus challenging old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Ilarion's discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old Russian literature.[PARAGRAPH:2]In his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on the Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. In 1030, he reconquered Red Rus from the Poles and concluded an alliance with King Casimir I of Poland, sealed by the latter's marriage to Yaroslav's sister Maria.[PARAGRAPH:2]To defend his state from the Pechenegs and other nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of forts, composed of Yuriev, Boguslav, Kaniv, Korsun, and Pereyaslav. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs in 1036 (who thereupon never were a threat to Kiev) he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037. Other celebrated monuments of his reign, such as the Golden Gates of Kiev, have since perished.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1043, Yaroslav staged a naval raid against Constantinople led by his son Vladimir and general Vyshata. Although the Rus' navy was defeated, Yaroslav managed to conclude the war with a favourable treaty and prestigious marriage of his son Vsevolod to the emperor's daughter.</English>

After the death of Matthias's father, there was a struggle between Hungary's various barons and its Habsburg King. The gentry and the people of Pest finally came out in support of Matthias as king, while most barons also agreed to support him.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 20, 1458, Matthias was elected king by the Diet. At this time, he was the hostage of the king of Bohemia who released under the condition of marrying his daughter. Matthias was finally crowned after several wars with Bohemia and the new Emperor Frederick III gave him the Holy Crown. Only the age of 15, Matthias began his reign by building public health, education, and a new legal system. Matthias was also a fan of art and culture, as many artists were present in his court.[TAB]Matthias gained independence by dividing the barons and raising a large royal army. At this time, Hungary reached its greatest territorial extent of the era. Matthias was victorious in several campaigns against the Ottoman Empire by raising the Kingdom of Hungary to be a world power. After that, Matthias was intent in conquering large parts of the Holy Roman Empire. By the end of his reign, he was in control of places such as Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, half of Austria, and Vienna.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Vlad III Dracula, Prince of Wallachia, had many successes against the Ottoman Empire, Matthias imprisoned him after a disagreement between the two rulers. Hungary decided to help Dracula in his fight of the threatening Ottomans, but he was assassinated. This was a major blow to the position of Hungary. In 1467, a conflict arose between Matthias and the Moldavian Prince Stephen III, after he became worn out by Hungary's policies and their presence at Kilia. A revenge lead by Stephen leads to the defeat of Matthias at the Battle of Baia. Matthias died in 1490 in Vienna, Austria, and his empire collapsed after his death because of the fact that his son was not accepted as king.</English>

His father was the Magyar chieftain Geza: his mother was Sarolt (Polish: Adelajda) from the Polish dynasty of the Piasts, and Stephen was given the name Vajk (meaning hero) at birth. Born a pagan in the town of Esztergom, Vajk was baptized, as a precondition of accepting the crown from Rome, at age 10 by Saint Adalbert of Prague, and given the baptismal name Stephen (in honor of the original early Christian Saint Stephen), protector of the church at Passau).[PARAGRAPH:2]He was married in 995 to Gizella of Bavaria (though some sources give other years for the marriage), the daughter of Henry II the Wrangler, and his wife Gisela of Burgundy. Stephen and Gizella had at least three children; we know the names of the sons Imre (Henry or Emeric) and Ott?(Otto) and the daughter Hedvig (Hedwig). All of Stephen's children apparently predeceased him and left no descendants to claim the throne upon his death, so that the crown had to be contended for by his nephews and cousins.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 995 and 997, Stephen (under the name "Vajk") was the prince of Nitra (a Slovak Christian center and the capital of the Nitrian principality in present day south-western Slovakia) and was living in Nitra together with his wife.[PARAGRAPH:2]After battling and defeating the pagan nobles who opposed him (including his uncle, a powerful warlord named Koppny), Stephen became the Sovereign of Magyars in Transdanubia in 997 and till 1006 managed to successfully unite virtually all the Magyar clans. The victory over Koppny was achieved also thanks to the substantial material and military assistance from the Slovak Christian noblemen Poznan and Hunt. According to Hungarian tradition, Pope Silvester II sent a magnificent jeweled gold crown to Stephen (which became the symbol of Hungary under the name of the Holy Crown) along with an apostolic cross and a letter of blessing in the beginning of January, 1001 to officially recognize him as a Christian king of Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen divided Hungary into 40-50 counties, and continued the work of his father Geza by applying the decimal organizational system of his ancestors and setting up ten dioceses in Hungary, ordering every ten villages to erect one church and maintain a priest. He founded the cathedrals of Szkesfehrvr and Esztergom, the Nunnery of Veszprm, the Benedictine Abbey of Pannonhalma, and the Monastery of Saint Peter and Paul in Buda. Inside the abbeys and monasteries, schools were established and they became important centers of culture. Saint Astricus served as Stephen's advisor, and Stephen also had Saint Gerard Sagredo as the tutor for his son Saint Emeric (Imre).[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen discouraged pagan customs and strengthened Christianity with various laws, including ending the use of the old Hun-Magyar runic alphabet and making Latin the official language of the royal court. Stephen gave generously to the churches, personally visited them often, and supervised their construction. He often disguised himself as a peasant whenever he traveled, and freely gave money to any poor people he met (in one account, Stephen was beaten and robbed by a group of beggars to whom he was giving alms, but he forgave them and spared their lives).[PARAGRAPH:2]He intended to retire to a life of holy contemplation and hand the kingdom over to his only surviving son Imre, but in 1031 Imre was wounded in a hunting accident and died.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen mourned a very long time over the loss of his favorite son Imre, which took a great toll on his health. He eventually recovered, but he never regained his original vitality. Having no children left, he could not find anyone among his remaining relatives who was able to rule the country competently and willing to maintain the Christian faith of the nation. Unable to choose an heir, King Stephen died at Szkesfehrvr (a city he built in central Hungary) on the Feast of the Assumption, and was buried there. Both his nobles and his subjects were said to have mourned for 3 straight years afterwards.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly after his death, healing miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb. Stephen was canonized by the Vatican as Saint Stephen of Hungary in 1083. Catholics venerate him as the patron saint of: Hungary, kings, the death of children, masons, stonecutters, and bricklayers. His feast is on September 2, but in Hungary his chief festival is observed on August 20, the day on which his sacred relics were transferred to the city of Buda; this day is a public holiday in Hungary.[PARAGRAPH:2]His crown, known as the Holy Crown, is currently (since 2000) enshrined in the Hungarian Parliament building, in Budapest.</English>

    <English>[H1]Frederick Barbarossa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Germany, Italy, Burgundy and Holy Roman Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1122 - June 10, 1190 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Frederick I Barbarossa was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March, crowned King of Italy in Pavia in 1154, and finally crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV on 18 June 1155. He was crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on 30 June 1178. The name Barbarossa came from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule, and means "red beard". Before his royal election, he was by inheritance Duke of Swabia (1147-1152, as Frederick III). He was the son of Duke Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. His mother was Judith, daughter of Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Welf, and Frederick therefore descended from Germany's two leading families, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire's prince-electors.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born in Waiblingen, the son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia, and the nephew of Conrad III, king of Germany. Conrad III, favouring Frederick over his own son, on his deathbed recommended to the German princes that Frederick be chosen for the German kingship and the imperial throne. Accordingly, after the death of his uncle in 1152, Frederick Barbarossa was made German king and elected Holy Roman emperor (see Holy Roman Empire). He conceived of his imperial title as a grant from God, through the German princes, and wished to restore the glory of the Roman Empire. He consequently decided to consolidate the imperial position in Germany and Italy and began by issuing a general order for peace among the princes of Germany, at the same time granting them extensive concessions. In 1154 he proceeded to Italy, where he received the Lombard crown at Pavia. The following year he was crowned Holy Roman emperor by Pope Adrian IV, whose authority Frederick had reinstated before his coronation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1156 Pope Adrian aroused Frederick against the papacy by implying in a letter to him that the emperor held lands only as a fief from the pope. Two years later Frederick incurred the hostility of the Lombards by demanding recognition of all his royal rights, including his power to appoint the imperial podesta, or governor, in every town. Such cities as Milan, Piacenza, Brescia, and Cremona considered that demand a denial of their communal liberties and in 1158 began a struggle that lasted until 1183 and required Frederick to lead five expeditions to Italy. Between 1158 and 1162 Frederick warred with Milan and its allies, subduing that city and confirming claims to other Italian cities. Meanwhile Frederick had set up a series of antipopes in opposition to the reigning pope, Alexander III, who supported the cause of the Milanese and their allies and who, in 1165, excommunicated Frederick. By attacking the Leonine City in Rome in 1167-1168, Frederick was able to install one of the antipopes, Paschal III, on the papal throne. The Lombard League, consisting of the cities of Milan, Parma, Padua (Padova), Verona, Piacenza, Bologna, Cremona, Mantua (Mantova), Bergamo, and Brescia, was formed in 1167 and eventually acknowledged Pope Alexander as leader. During the next seven years the league acquired military strength, rebuilt Milan, constructed the fortress city of Alessandria, and organized a federal system of administration. The fifth expedition (1174-1176) of Frederick to Italy terminated in defeat by the Lombard League at Legnano. The defeat was significant in military history, because it was the first major triumph of infantry over a mounted army of feudal knights. Frederick was forced in 1177 to acknowledge Alexander III as pope and in 1183 to sign the Peace of Constance, agreeing to the demands of the Lombards for autonomy but retaining imperial authority over the towns.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although imperial control in Italy was virtually ended by his defeat at Legnano, Frederick managed to enhance his prestige in central Europe. He made Poland tributary to the empire, raised Bohemia to the rank of a kingdom, and erected the margravate of Austria into an independent hereditary duchy. His own power as emperor in Germany was firmly established in 1180, when he ended his long struggle with the Welfs by putting down a revolt led by the Welf Henry the Lion and depriving him of most of his lands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Frederick initiated the Third Crusade in 1189, and in the next year, having resigned the government of the empire to his son Henry, later Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, set out for Asia Minor. After gaining two great victories over the Muslims at Philomelion (now Aksehir) and Iconium (now Konya), he has drowned in the Calycadnus (now Gksu) River in Cilicia (now in Turkey) on June 10, 1190.</English>

Last of the Piast Dynasty, king of Poland from 1333, the son of Wladyslaw I the Short (Wladyslaw I Lokietek).[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir is the only Polish king who did receive and maintain the title of the great in Polish history (Boleslaw I Chrobry was once also called the great, but not today), and the title is well deserved. When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him "king of Krakow. The economy was ruined, and country was depopulated and tired with wars. At the time of his death, it had doubled in land area (mostly through joining lands in today's Ukraine, then Duchy of Halicz), grew prosperous, wealthy and had great prospects to the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was preparing other ones just before he died.[PARAGRAPH:2]He built many new castles, reformed the Polish army, as well as Polish civil and criminal laws. At the Sejm in Wislica, March 11, 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms in the jurisprudence of his country. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Little Poland, which gained for him the title of "the Polish Justinian". He founded the University of Krakow although his death stalled the development of the university (and that's why today it is called Jagiellonian instead of Casimirian).He organised a meeting of kings in Krakow in 1364 which showed the wealth of Polish kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir was sonless. Apparently he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable to inherit or too young. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession instead of problems of uncertainty, he arranged his sister Elisabeth, Dowager Queen of Hungary, and her son Louis, King of Hungary to be his successors in Poland. Louis was proclaimed polish king in Casimir's death in 1370, but Elisabeth held much of the practical power until her death in 1380.</English>

He had won fame as an outstanding military commander in wars against the Ottomans, Tatars, Muscovites, Cossacks and Swedes.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1665 he became Great Marshal of the Crown, and in 1666 Field Crown Hetman. In 1668 he was appointed by King Jan II Kazimierz the Great Crown Hetman and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army. After a distinguished military career, and following the death of Jan II Kazimierz's successor, Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki, Sobieski was on May 21, 1674, elected by the szlachta (nobility) to be King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was crowned February 2, 1676.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jan Sobieski's military prowess, demonstrated in war against the Ottoman Empire, contributed to his election as King of Poland. One of his ambitions was to unify Christian Europe in a crusade to drive the Turks out of Europe. He made alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor and joined the Holy League initiated by Pope Innocent XI to preserve Christendom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sobieski planned to occupy Prussia with Swedish cooperation and French support. This undertaking was doomed because of war with Turkey and the opposition of the Commonwealth's magnates.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sobieski's greatest success came September 12, 1683, with his victory at the Battle of Vienna, in command of Polish, Austrian and German troops, against the Turks under Kara Mustafa. The Pope and other foreign dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the "Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization." In a letter to his wife he wrote, "All the common people kissed my hands, my feet, my clothes; others only touched me, saying: 'Ah, let us kiss so valiant a hand!'"[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon reaching Vienna, he joined up with the Austrians and Germans. Sobieski planned to attack on the 13th of September, but he had noticed that the Turkish resistance was weak and ordered full attack on September 12, 1683. At 4:00 a.m. Sobieski's army of about 81,000 men attacked a Turkish army that numbered about 130,000. Sobieski charged with husaria forward and soon after the Turkish battle line was broken as the Turks scattered in confusion. At 5:30 p.m., Sobieski entered the deserted tent of Kara Mustafa and the battle of Vienna was over.[PARAGRAPH:2]King Jan III Sobieski, nicknamed by the Turks the "Lion of Lechistan", and the last great king of Poland, died in Wilan, Poland on June 17, 1696. His wife, Maria Kasimira, died in 1716 in Blois, France and her body was returned to Poland. They are interred together in Wawel Castle, Krakow, Poland.</English>

    <English>[H1]Ivan "the Terrible" IV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]First Tsar of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] August 25, 1530 - March 18, 1584 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ivan IV was the Grand Duke of Muscovy from 1533 to 1547 and was the first ruler of Russia to assume the title of tsar. His long reign saw the conquest of Kazan Khanate and Siberia and subsequent transformation of Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state. This tsar retains his place in the Russian tradition simply as Ivan Grozny, which is traditionally translated into English as Ivan the Terrible.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan (or Ioann, as his name is rendered in Church Slavonic) was a long-awaited son of Vasili III. Upon his father's death, he formally came to the throne at the age of three, but his minority was dominated by regents. Initially his mother Elena Glinskaya acted as regent, but she died when Ivan was only eight. She was replaced as regent by boyars from the Shuisky family until Ivan assumed power in 1544. According to his own letters, Ivan customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. These traumatic experiences may have contributed to his hatred of the boyars and to his mental instability. He was known to throw cats and dogs out of the Kremlin windows, among other cruel acts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan was crowned king with Monomakh's Cap at the Cathedral of the Dormition at age sixteen on January 16, 1547. Despite calamities triggered by the Great Fire of 1547, the early part of his reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization. Ivan revised the law code (known as the sudebnik), created a standing army (the streltsy), established the first Russian parliament of the feudal estates (the Zemsky Sobor), the council of the nobles (known as the Chosen Council), and confirmed the position of the Church with the Council of the Hundred Chapters, which unified the rituals and ecclesiastical regulations of the entire country. He introduced the local self-management in rural regions, mainly in the Northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry. During his reign the first printing press was introduced to Russia (although the first Russian printers Ivan Fedorov and Pyotr Mstislavets had to flee from Moscow to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania).[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan formed new trading connections, opening up the White Sea and the port of Arkhangelsk to the Muscovy Company of English merchants. In 1552 he defeated the Kazan Khanate, whose armies had repeatedly devastated the Northeast of Russia, and annexed its territory. In 1556, he annexed the Astrakhan Khanate and destroyed the largest slave market on the river Volga. These conquests complicated the migration of the aggressive nomadic hordes from Asia to Europe through Volga and transformed Russia into a multinational and multiconfessional state. He had St. Basil's Cathedral constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of Kazan. Legend has it that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architects blinded, so that they could never design anything as beautiful again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Other less positive aspects of this period include the introduction of the first laws restricting the mobility of the peasants, which would eventually lead to serfdom. The dramatic change in Ivan's personality is traditionally linked to his near-fatal illness in 1553 and the death of his first wife, Anastasia Romanovna in 1560. Ivan suspected boyars of poisoning his wife and of plotting to replace him on the throne with his cousin, Vladimir of Staritsa. In addition, during that illness Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the tsar's health too hopeless to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and murders of innocent people, including Metropolitan Philip and Prince Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky.[PARAGRAPH:2]Also problematic was the 1565 formation of the Oprichnina. The Oprichnina was the section of Russia (mainly the Northeast) directly ruled by Ivan and policed by his personal servicemen, the Oprichniki. This whole system of Oprichnina has been viewed by some historians as a tool against the omnipotent hereditary nobility of Russia (boyars) who opposed the absolutist drive of the tsar, while others have interpreted it as a sign of the paranoia and mental deterioration of the tsar.[PARAGRAPH:2]The later half of Ivan's reign was far less successful. Although Khan Devlet I Giray of Crimea repeatedly devastated Moscow region and even set Moscow on fire in 1571, the tsar supported Yermak's conquest of Tatar Siberia, adopting a policy of empire-building, which led him to launch a victorious war of seaward expansion to the west, only to find himself fighting the Swedes, Lithuanians, Poles, and the Livonian Teutonic Knights.[PARAGRAPH:2]For twenty-four years the Livonian War dragged on, damaging the Russian economy and military and failing to gain any territory for Russia. In the 1560s the combination of drought and famine, Polish-Lithuanian raids, Tatar invasions, and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the Hanseatic League devastated Russia. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten. Epidemics of the plague killed 10,000 in Novgorod. In 1570 the plague killed 600-1000 in Moscow daily. Ivan's closest advisor, Prince Andrei Kurbsky, defected to the Lithuanians, headed the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of Velikiye Luki. This treachery deeply hurt Ivan. As the Oprichnina continued, Ivan became mentally unstable and physically disabled. In one week, he could easily pass from the most depraved orgies to prayers and fasting in a remote northern monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because he gradually grew unbalanced and violent, the Oprichniks under Malyuta Skuratov soon got out of hand and became murderous thugs. They massacred nobles and peasants, and conscripted men to fight the war in Livonia. Depopulation and famine ensued. What had been by far the richest area of Russia became the poorest. In a dispute with the wealthy city of Novgorod, Ivan ordered the Oprichniks to murder inhabitants of this city, which was never to regain its former prosperity. Between thirty and forty thousand might have been killed during the infamous Massacre of Novgorod in 1570; many others were deported elsewhere. Yet the official death toll named 1,500 of Novgorod big people (nobility) and only mentioned about the same number of smaller people. Many modern researchers estimate number of victims between two and three thousand. (After the famine and epidemics of 1560s the population of Novgorod did not exceed 10,000-20,000.)[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law for wearing immodest clothing, causing a miscarriage. His son, also named Ivan, upon learning of this, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff, causing his son's (accidental) death. This event is depicted in the famous painting by Ilya Repin, Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on Friday, November 16, 1581 better known as Ivan the Terrible killing his son.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although it is thought by many that Ivan died while setting up a chess board, it is more likely that he died while playing chess with Bogdan Belsky on March 18, 1584. When Ivan's tomb was opened during renovations in the 1960s, his remains were examined and discovered to contain very high amounts of mercury, indicating a high probability that he was poisoned. Modern suspicion falls on his advisors Belsky and Boris Godunov (who became tsar in 1598). Three days earlier, Ivan had allegedly attempted to rape Irina, Godunov's sister and Feodor's wife. Her cries attracted Godunov and Belsky to the noise, whereupon Ivan let Irina go, but Belsky and Godunov considered themselves marked for death. The tradition says that they either poisoned or strangled Ivan in fear for their own lives. The mercury found in Ivan's remains may also be related to treatment for syphilis, which it is speculated that Ivan had. Upon Ivan's death, the ravaged kingdom was left to his unfit and childless son Feodor.</English>

[PARAGRAPH:2]利沃尼亚战争持续了24年，破坏了俄罗斯的经济和军事，没有为俄罗斯赢得任何领土。在15世纪60年代，干旱和饥荒、波兰-立陶宛袭击、鞑靼人入侵以及瑞典人、波兰人和汉萨同盟实施的海上贸易封锁共同摧毁了俄罗斯。粮食价格上涨了十倍。在诺夫哥罗德，鼠疫的流行导致10000人死亡。1570年，莫斯科每天有600-1000人死于瘟疫。伊万最亲密的顾问安德烈・库尔布斯基公爵叛逃到立陶宛人手中，领导立陶宛军队，摧毁了俄罗斯的韦利基耶・卢基地区。这种背叛深深地伤害了伊万。随着奥普拉奇尼娜的继续，伊凡变得精神不稳定，身体残疾。在一周内，他可以轻松地从最堕落的狂欢转变为在偏僻的北部修道院祈祷和禁食。[PARAGRAPH:2]因为他逐渐变得不平衡和暴力，马尔尤塔・斯库拉托夫领导下的奥普里什尼克人很快失控，成为凶残的暴徒。他们屠杀贵族和农民，征募士兵到利沃尼亚打仗。人口减少和饥荒接踵而至。到目前为止，俄罗斯最富裕的地区变成了最贫穷的地区。在与富裕城市诺夫哥罗德的一场纠纷中，伊万命令奥普拉尼克一家谋杀这座城市的居民，这座城市永远无法恢复昔日的繁荣。在1570年臭名昭著的诺夫哥罗德大屠杀中，可能有三万到四万人被杀；还有许多人被驱逐到其他地方。然而官方公布的死亡人数中有1500人是诺夫哥罗德的大人物（贵族），只提到了同样数量的小人物。许多现代研究人员估计，受害者人数在2000至3000人之间。（在1560年代的饥荒和流行病之后，诺夫哥罗德的人口不超过1万到2万。）[PARAGRAPH:2]1581年，伊万殴打怀孕的儿媳，因为她穿着不得体的衣服，导致流产。他的儿子，也叫伊万，在得知此事后，与父亲发生了激烈的争吵，导致伊万用尖头棒击中儿子的头部，导致儿子（意外）死亡。1581年11月16日，星期五，伊利亚・雷宾、可怕的伊万和他的儿子伊万在著名的画作中描述了这一事件，人们更熟悉的说法是可怕的伊万杀死了他的儿子。[PARAGRAPH:2]尽管很多人认为伊万是在设立棋盘时死的，但他更有可能是在3月18日与博格丹・贝尔斯基下棋时死的，1584.当伊万的坟墓在20世纪60年代翻修期间被打开时，对他的遗体进行了检查，发现其中含有非常高的汞，这表明他很有可能中毒。现代人怀疑他的顾问贝尔斯基和鲍里斯・戈杜诺夫（1598年成为沙皇）。三天前，Ivan涉嫌强奸Godunov的妹妹和Feodor的妻子Irina。她的哭声吸引了戈杜诺夫和贝尔斯基的注意，于是伊凡放走了伊琳娜，但贝尔斯基和戈杜诺夫认为自己注定要死。传统上说，他们不是毒死就是勒死伊万，因为他们害怕自己的生命。在伊万遗体中发现的汞也可能与梅毒治疗有关，据推测，伊万患有梅毒。伊万死后，被蹂躏的王国留给了他不健康、没有孩子的儿子费奥多。</Chinese>

Boccanegra was opposed by the aristocratic Guelf faction, representing the old mercantile nobility, which his first actions excluded from public life. With the old nobility excluded from power, a new class of mercantile houses arose: Adorno, Guarco, Fregoso, and Montaldo.[PARAGRAPH:2]During Boccanegra's dogate, Genoese control was extended the length of both the French and Italian Rivieras, with the exception of the Grimaldi holdings in Monaco and Ventimiglia, and Genoese galleys went to the aid of Alfonso XI of Castile in his struggles against the Saracens.[PARAGRAPH:2]There were constant conspiracies and attempts against Boccanegra's life from the outset. (The first conspirator's head rolled on December 20, 1339) This led to the establishment of a bodyguard of 103 mounted soldiers. For Boccanegra's security these were drawn from Pisa, the inveterate enemy of Genoa, where, however, Simone's brother Niccolo was "captain of the people", their mother having been a Pisan aristocrat.[PARAGRAPH:2]Boccanegra was forced to resign his office at a public meeting he had called in December of 1344. Giovanni Valente ruled as chief magistrate, until Boccanegra regained power in 1356. After a couple of very succesful years (both for Genoa and for the Boccanegra family), Simone was fatally poisoned in 1363.[PARAGRAPH:2]Simone Boccanegra's tomb in the church of San Francesco in Castelletto was decorated with a remarkable funeral sculpture, depicting him as if lying in state with extraordinary realism in his features. This sculpture is now in the Museum of Sant'Agostino. Boccanegra's story was popularized by Giuseppe Verdi's famous opera: "Simon Boccanegra"</English>

He was also Duke of Normandy from 3 July 1035 until his death. Before his conquest of England, he was known as William the Bastard (Guillaume le Btard) because of the illegitimacy of his birth.[PARAGRAPH:2]To press his claim to the English crown, William invaded England in 1066, leading an army of Normans, Bretons, Flemings, and Frenchmen (from Paris and le-de-France) to victory over the English forces of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest.[PARAGRAPH:2]His reign, which brought Norman-French culture to England, had an impact on the subsequent course of England in the Middle Ages. The details of that impact and the extent of the changes have been debated by scholars for centuries. In addition to the obvious change of ruler, his reign also saw a programme of building and fortification, changes to the English language, a shift in the upper levels of society and the church, and adoption of some aspects of continental church reform.</English>

He fought several successful campaigns against the Moors and, on July 26, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Leon-Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the archbishop of Braga, to confirm the independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal still had to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most importantly, by the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. Afonso wedded Mafalda of Savoy, daughter of Count Amadeo III of Savoy, and sent Ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile or Leon. Afonso declared himself the direct liegeman of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santarmand Lisbon in 1147. He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce Berenguer, sister of the Count of Barcelona, and princess of Aragon. Finally, in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and Leon that Portugal was an independent kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the papal bull "Manifestis Probatum", Pope Alexander III acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Castilian attempts of annexation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1184, in spite of his great age, he had still sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in Santarm by the Moors. He died shortly after, in 1185.[NEWLINE]The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation.</English>

    <English>[H1]Maximilian I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Holy Roman Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] March 22, 1459 - January 12, 1519 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Maximilian I, Holy Roman emperor, son of the emperor Frederick III and Leonora, daughter of Edward, King of Portugal, was born at Vienna Neustadt on the 22nd of March 1459. On the 18th of August 1477, by his marriage at Ghent to Mary, who had just inherited Burgundy and the Netherlands from her father Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, he effected a union of great importance in the history of the house of Habsburg. He at once undertook the defense of his wife's dominions from an attack by Louis XI, king of France, and defeated the French forces at Guinegatte, the modern Enguinegatte, on the 7th of August 1479. But Maximilian was regarded with suspicion by the states of Netherlands, and after suppressing a rising in Gelderland his position was further weakened by the death of his wife on the 27th of March 1482. He claimed to be recognized as guardian of his young son Philip and as regent of the Netherlands, but some of the states refused to agree to his demands and disorder was general. Maximilian was compelled to assent to the treaty of Arras in 1482 between the states of the Netherlands and Louis XI. This treaty provided that Maximilian's daughter Margaret of Austria should marry Charles, the dauphin of France, and have for her dowry Artois and Franche-Comt? two of the provinces in dispute, while the claim of Louis on the Duchy of Burgundy was tacitly admitted. Maximilian did not, however, abandon the struggle in the Netherlands. Having crushed a rebellion at Utrecht, he compelled the burghers of Ghent to restore Philip to him in 1485, and returning to Germany was chosen king of the Romans, or German king, at Frankfurt on the 16th of February 1486, and crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 9th of the following April. Again in the Netherlands, he made a treaty with Francis II, Duke of Brittany, whose independence was threatened by the French regent, Anne of Beaujeu, and the struggle with France was soon renewed. This war was very unpopular with the trading cities of the Netherlands, and early in 1488 Maximilian, having entered Bruges, was detained there as a prisoner for nearly three months, and only set at liberty on the approach of his father with a large force. On his release he had promised he would maintain the treaty of Arras and withdraw from the Netherlands; but he delayed his departure for nearly a year and took part in a punitive campaign against his captors and their allies. On his return to Germany he made peace with France at Frankfurt in July 1489, and in October several of the states of the Netherlands recognized him as their ruler and as guardian of his son. In March 1490 the county of Tirol was added to his possessions through the abdication of his kinsman, Count Sigismund, and this district soon became his favorite residence.[PARAGRAPH:2]In August 1493 the death of the emperor left Maximilian sole ruler of Germany and head of the house of Habsburg; and on the 16th of March 1494 he married at Innsbruck Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan (d. 1476). At this time Bianca's uncle, Ludovico Sforza, was invested with the Duchy of Milan in return for the substantial dowry which his niece brought to the king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maximilian harbored the idea of driving the Turks from Europe; but his appeal to all Christian sovereigns was ineffectual. In 1494 he was again in the Netherlands, where he led an expedition against the rebels of Gelderland, assisted Perkin Warbeck to make a descent upon England, and formally handed over the government of the Low Countries to Philip. His attention was next turned to Italy, and, alarmed at the progress of Charles VIII in the peninsula, he signed the league of Venice in March 1495, and about the same time arranged a marriage between his son Philip and Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, king and queen of Castile and Aragon. The need for help to prosecute the war in Italy caused the king to call the diet to Worms in March 1495, when he urged the necessity of checking the progress of Charles. As during his father's lifetime Maximilian had favored the reforming party among the princes, proposals for the better government of the empire were brought forward at Worms as a necessary preliminary to financial and military support. Some reforms were adopted, the public peace was proclaimed without any limitation of time and a general tax was levied.[PARAGRAPH:2]The three succeeding years were mainly occupied with quarrels with the diet, with two invasions of France, and a war in Gelderland against Charles, count of Egmont, who claimed that duchy, and was supported by French troops. The reforms of 1495 were rendered abortive by the refusal of Maximilian to attend the diets or to take any part in the working of the new constitution, and in 1497 he strengthened his own authority by establishing an Aulic Council (Reichshofrath), which he declared was competent to deal with all business of the empire, and about the same time set up a court to centralize the financial administration of Germany.[PARAGRAPH:2]In February 1499 the king became involved in a war with the Swiss, who had refused to pay the imperial taxes or to furnish a contribution for the Italian expedition. Aided by France they defeated the German troops, and the peace of Basel in September 1499 recognized them as virtually independent of the empire. About this time Maximilian's ally, Ludovico of Milan, was taken prisoner by Louis XII, King of France, and Maximilian was again compelled to ask the diet for help. An elaborate scheme for raising an army was agreed to, and in return a council of regency (Reichsregiment) was established, which amounted, in the words of a Venetian envoy, to a deposition of the king. The relations were now very strained between the reforming princes and Maximilian, who, unable to raise an army, refused to attend the meetings of the council at Nuremberg, while both parties treated for peace with France. The hostility of the king rendered the council impotent. He was successful in winning the support of many of the younger princes, and in establishing a new court of justice, the members of which were named by himself. The negotiations with France ended in the treaty of Blois, signed in September 1504, when Maximilian's grandson Charles was betrothed to Claude, daughter of Louis XII, and Louis, invested with the Duchy of Milan, agreed to aid the king of the Romans to secure the imperial crown. A succession difficulty in Bavaria-Landshut was only decided after Maximilian had taken up arms and narrowly escaped with his life at Regensburg. In the settlement of this question, made in 1505, he secured a considerable increase of territory, and when the king met the diet at Cologne in 1505 he was at the height of his power. His enemies at home were crushed, and their leader, Berthold, elector of Mainz, was dead; while the outlook abroad was more favorable than it had been since his accession.</English>

[H1]马西米兰一世[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]神圣罗马皇帝[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生活于公元1459年3月22日至1519年1月12日[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB TAB]马西米兰一世，神圣罗马皇帝，弗雷德里克三世的儿子，葡萄牙国王爱德华的女儿莱昂诺拉，1459年3月22日出生于维也纳纽施塔特。1477年8月18日，他在根特与玛丽结婚，玛丽刚刚从她父亲勃艮第公爵查尔斯・博尔德手中继承了勃艮第和荷兰，从而促成了哈布斯堡家族历史上的一次重要结合。他立即从法国国王路易斯席的进攻中，为妻子的领土辩护，并于八月七日1479日在法国现代格尼加特的英吉加特打败了法国军队。但马西米兰受到荷兰各州的怀疑，在镇压盖尔德兰起义后，他的地位因1482年3月27日妻子去世而进一步削弱。他声称被承认为他年幼儿子菲利普的监护人和荷兰摄政王，但一些州拒绝同意他的要求，混乱是普遍的。马希米莲被迫同意在1482年荷兰和路易斯席之间签订《阿拉斯条约》。该条约规定，马克西米利安的女儿奥地利玛格丽特应嫁给法国王储查尔斯，并以阿尔托瓦和弗朗西・孔特作为嫁妆？有争议的两个省份，而路易对勃艮第公爵领地的主张被默许。然而，马西米兰并没有放弃在荷兰的斗争。在镇压了乌得勒支的叛乱之后，他于1485年迫使根特的市民将菲利普归还给他，并于1486年2月16日在法兰克福被选为罗马人国王或德国国王，并于次年4月9日在艾克斯・拉查佩尔加冕。再次在荷兰，他与布列塔尼公爵弗朗西斯二世（Francis II）签订了一项条约，布列塔尼公爵的独立受到了法国摄政王博尤的安妮（Anne of Beaujeu）的威胁，与法国的斗争很快重新开始。这场战争在荷兰的贸易城市中非常不受欢迎，1488年初，马克西米利安进入布鲁日，在那里被囚禁了近三个月，直到他父亲带着一支庞大的军队接近时才被释放。获释时，他曾承诺维持《阿拉斯条约》，并退出荷兰；但他推迟了将近一年的离境，并参与了一场针对绑架者及其盟友的惩罚性行动。1489年7月，他回到德国，在法兰克福与法国达成和平。10月，荷兰几个州承认他为自己的统治者和儿子的监护人。1490年3月，他的亲属西吉斯蒙德伯爵退位，使提洛县成为他的属地，这一地区很快成为他最喜欢的住所。
1493年8月，皇帝去世，马克西米兰成为德国唯一的统治者和哈布斯堡家族的首领；1494年3月16日，他在因斯布鲁克比安卡（Innsbruck Bianca）与米兰公爵盖拉佐・斯福尔扎（Galeazzo Sforza，公元1476年）的女儿玛丽亚・斯福尔扎（Maria Sforza）结婚。此时，比安卡的叔叔卢多维科・斯福尔扎（Ludovico Sforza）被投资于米兰公国，作为他侄女给国王带来大量嫁妆的回报。[PARAGRAPH:2]马西米兰怀有将土耳其人赶出欧洲的想法；但他对所有基督教君主的呼吁是无效的。1494年，他再次来到荷兰，在那里他领导了一支反对盖德兰叛军的远征队，协助珀金・沃贝克向英格兰登陆，并正式将低地国政府移交给菲利普。接着，他的注意力转向了意大利，对查理八世在半岛上的进展感到震惊，他于1495年3月签署了威尼斯联盟，并几乎同时安排了他的儿子菲利普和乔安娜之间的婚姻，乔安娜是费迪南和伊莎贝拉王后的女儿，伊莎贝拉是卡斯蒂利亚和阿拉贡的国王和王后。1495年3月，由于需要帮助以起诉意大利战争，国王呼吁国会停止战争，当时他敦促有必要检查查尔斯的进展情况。在他父亲的有生之年，马西米兰曾在王子中支持改革党，因此在沃姆斯会议上提出了改善帝国政府的建议，作为财政和军事支持的必要准备。通过了一些改革，宣布了公共和平，没有任何时间限制，并征收了一般税。[PARAGRAPH:2]接下来的三年主要是与国会的争吵，两次入侵法国，以及在盖尔德兰对埃格蒙特伯爵查尔斯的战争，查尔斯声称公爵，并得到法国军队的支持。1495年的改革因马西米兰拒绝参加议会或参与新宪法的实施而流产，1497年他通过成立一个奥里奇委员会（帝国）加强了自己的权威，他宣布该委员会有能力处理帝国的所有事务，大约在同一时间，建立了一个法院来集中德国的财政管理。[PARAGRAPH:2]1499年2月，国王卷入了与瑞士的战争，瑞士拒绝支付帝国税或为意大利远征提供捐款。在法国的帮助下，他们打败了德国军队，1499年9月的巴塞尔和平承认他们实际上独立于帝国。大约在这个时候，马西米兰的盟友、米兰的卢多维科被法国国王路易十二俘虏，马西米兰再次被迫向国会寻求帮助。一项精心策划的组建军队的计划获得通过，作为回报，成立了摄政委员会（帝国团），用一位威尼斯特使的话来说，这相当于国王的宣誓就职。改革中的王子们与马克西米利安之间的关系现在非常紧张，马克西米利安无法组建军队，拒绝参加纽伦堡的安理会会议，而双方都希望与法国实现和平。国王的敌意使议会无能为力。他成功地赢得了许多年轻王子的支持，并建立了一个新的法院，其成员由他自己任命。与法国的谈判在1504年9月签署的《布卢瓦条约》中结束，当时马西米兰的孙子查尔斯与路易十二的女儿克劳德订婚，路易在米兰公国投资，同意帮助罗马人国王获得皇冠。巴伐利亚州兰德舒特的继任困难是在马克西米利安拿起武器并在雷根斯堡侥幸逃脱后才决定的。在1505年解决这一问题时，他获得了相当大的领土扩张，1505年国王在科隆会见国会时，他正处于权力的顶峰。他在国内的敌人被击溃，他们的领导人，缅因州的选举人伯索尔德已经去世；尽管国外的前景比他上任以来更为乐观。</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]Gustav Vasa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden, Father of the Swedish nation[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 12, 1496 - September 29, 1560 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Gustav I, born Gustav Eriksson (Colloquial 15th century Upplandic, Gsta Jerksson) and later known as Gustav Vasa, was King of Sweden from 1523 until his death. He was the first monarch of the House of Vasa, an influential noble family which came to be the royal house of Sweden for much of the 16th and 17th centuries. Gustav I was elected regent in 1521 after leading a rebellion against Christian II of Denmark, the leader of the Kalmar Union who controlled most of Sweden at the time.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav was an enigmatic person who has been referred to as both a liberator of the country and as a tyrannical ruler, which has made him the subject of many books. When he came to power in 1523, he was largely unknown, and he became the ruler of a still divided country without a central government. Though not as famous as most of his continental contemporaries, he became the first truly autocratic native Swedish sovereign and was a skilled propagandist and bureaucrat who laid the foundations for a more efficient centralized government. During his reign Protestantism was introduced in the country. In traditional Swedish history he has been labelled the founder of modern Sweden, and the "father of the nation". Gustav liked to compare himself to Moses, whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temperament, but he also loved music, and had a certain sly wit.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav was born in Lindholmen, Sweden to a noble family, and was educated at the University of Uppsala. As a young man he entered the army, and from 1518 to 1519 he fought against Christian II, king of Denmark, who had invaded Sweden to regain the throne that the Danes had lost in 1501. Gustav was taken hostage but managed to escape. He was still a fugitive when he heard that Christian had massacred his father and other nationalist Swedish nobles in the Stockholm bloodbath of 1520. From 1521 to 1523, with an army of peasants, Gustav led a successful revolt and drove the Danes out of Sweden. His victory resulted in the dissolution of the Union of Kalmar, which in 1397 had placed Sweden and Norway under the Danish crown. Gustav was administrator of the kingdom from 1521 to 1523, when the Riksdag, or national assembly, elected him king. He strengthened his political hold and restored order by introducing the Reformation into Sweden. The Roman Catholic church had supported Christian II, and Gustav used this as an excuse for stripping the church of political power and confiscating its property. In 1527 he made Swedish bishops subject to royal power, and in 1529 he proclaimed Lutheranism the state religion. He joined with Norway in 1537 to defeat the German city of Lbeck, making Sweden economically independent of the Hanseatic League, a federation of German cities to enhance their commercial interests. Gustav created a strongly united state by introducing a sound financial administration, strengthening manufacturing, trade, and agricultural interests, and increasing the military forces. In 1544 he made the Swedish crown hereditary through his line, the house of Vasa. On his death, Gustav was succeeded by his son, Eric XIV.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav's heritage has been disputed. In 19th century Swedish history a folklore developed wherein Gustav was supposed to have had all kinds of adventures when he liberated Sweden from the Danes. The memory of Gustav has been honored greatly, resulting in embroidered history books, commemorative coins, and the annual ski event Vasaloppet (the largest ski event in the world with 15,000 participants). The city of Vaasa in Finland was named after the royal house of Vasa in 1606. Gustav is currently portrayed on the 1000 kronor note. Today most of these stories are considered to have no other foundation than legend and skilful propaganda by Gustav himself during his time. Gustav has been regarded by some as a power-hungry man who wished to control everything: the Church, the economy, the army and all foreign affairs. But in doing this, he also did manage to unite Sweden, a country that previously had no standardized language, and where individual provinces held a strong regional power. He also laid the foundation for Sweden's professional army that was to make Sweden into a regional superpower in the 17th century.</English>

    <English>[H1]The Pope[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Bishop of Rome[\BOLD][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]In the seventh century AD, Rome was under the nominal control of the Eastern Roman Empire, based in Constantinople. The Byzantines were unable or unwilling to protect the city from the growing Lombardian menace to the north, and more or less by default control of the city fell to the Catholic Bishop of Rome (who would later be titled "Pope"), the richest and most powerful man in the region.[PARAGRAPH:2]Using a cunning mixture of bribery as well as political and diplomatic power the Bishops had managed to keep the barbarians from the city, but the Lombardian pressure was increasing. Failing to get adequate aid from the Byzantines, the Bishops were forced to seek protection elsewhere. Pope Stephen II turned to Pepin the Short, a Frankish king who had just reunited the Frankish states. In exchange for the Church's sanction to Pepin's conquests, Pepin invaded Italy and drove the Lombards from Rome's gates. He also donated much of the captured land surrounding Rome to the Pope, greatly increasing the size of the Pope's holdings and creating the Papal States.[PARAGRAPH:2]In one stroke, the Pope had driven off the invaders and found a powerful counter to far-away Byzantine. The alliance between the Church and the Carolingians would be further cemented in 800 AD, when Pope Leo III crowned Pepin's son, Charlemagne, the first Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.</English>

    <English>[H1]George III[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Great Britain, King of Ireland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 4, 1738 - January 29, 1820 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]George III was born in 1738, first son of Frederick, Prince of Wales and Augusta. He married Charlotte of Mecklinburg-Strelitz in 1761, to whom he was devoted. The couple produced a prolific fifteen children: nine sons and six daughters. George was afflicted with porphyria, a maddening disease which disrupted his reign as early as 1765. Several attacks strained his grip on reality and debilitated him in the last years of his reign. Personal rule was given to his son George, the Prince Regent, in 1811. George III died blind, deaf and mad at Windsor Castle on January 29, 1820.[PARAGRAPH:2]George III succeeded his grandfather, George II, in 1760 (Frederick, Prince of Wales, had died in 1751 having never ruled). George was determined to recover the prerogative lost to the ministerial council by the first two Georges; in the first two decades of the reign, he methodically weakened the Whig party through bribery, coercion and patronage. Prime Minister, William Pitt the Elder was toppled by Whigs after the Peace of Paris, and men of mediocre talent and servile minds were hand-picked by George as Cabinet members, acting as little more than yes-men. Bouts with madness and the way he handled the American Revolution eroded his support and the power of the Crown was granted again to the Prime Minister.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Peace of Paris (1763) ended the Seven Years' War with France, with the strenuous, anti-French policies of the elder Pitt emphasizing naval superiority in the colonial warfare. Great Britain emerged from the conflict as the world's greatest colonial power. England thrived under peacetime conditions, but George's commitment to taxing the American colonies to pay for military protection led to hostilities in 1775. The colonists proclaimed independence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final American victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Peace of Versailles, signed in 1783, ensured British acknowledgment of the United States of America. The defeat cost George dearly: his sanity was stretched to the breaking point and his political power decreased when William Pitt the Younger became Prime Minister in 1783. George reclaimed some of his power, driving Pitt from office from 1801-04, but his condition worsened again and he ceased to rule in 1811.[PARAGRAPH:2]The peace following the French war settlement was short-lived. A mere ten years later, England joined a continental alliance against French revolutionary forces who, after gaining power in France, sought total French hegemony across Europe. By 1797, the largest part of Europe was under French dominance, with England standing alone against the revolutionary Republic. The British Navy again proved decisive, defeating French forces at Camperdown, Cape St. Vincent and the Battle of the Nile in 1797, and finally at Copenhagen in 1801. Peace was negotiated at Amiens in 1802, with the French supreme on land and the British at sea. Napoleon Bonaparte seized supreme power in France at the turn of the century, and renewed attacks against England in 1803. Hostilities with France lasted until 1814 taking several forms. Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, led the land attack; the navy, commanded by Lord Horatio Nelson won the decisive battle off Cape Trafalgar, and imposed a blockade of Europe to offset Napoleon's " continental system" which was forbidden from importing British goods; and the younger Pitt guided the government through the hardships of total war. In addition to the continental conflict, England went to war again with the United States between 1812-14, over the British practice of pressing American seamen into service in the British Navy. Both conflicts were resolved in 1814; Napoleon was deposed and England agreed not to abscond with American sailors. Napoleon returned to Europe briefly in 1815, but was soundly defeated by continental forces led by Wellington.</English>

He was born in the 1240s, and had his origins in Jolster in Sunnfjord, where he also had an estate. Here he built a castle, which was one of only a few in Norway. His mother came from Eastern Norway, and is believed to have been a relative of king Haakon Haakonsson (1204-1263). His father seems to have belonged to the lower nobility, and never reached a high position.[PARAGRAPH:2]Norway reached its geographical maximum during the reign of Haakon Haakonsson, and Norway claimed to control Iceland, Greenland, the northern and western regions of Scotland, as well as the northern isles of Scotland and the Faroes. The country was integrated into Europe to a much higher degree than in earlier days, and king Haakon saw his daughter Kristina married to a Spanish Prince. During his reign the Civil War of Norway ended (1240), and he consequently paid much attention on "building" peace.[PARAGRAPH:2]King Haakon took a strong personal interest in judicial matters, and he started the process of legal reform in Norway. Audun must have been judicially trained, most likely at universities on the Continent like Paris and Bologna. The judicial philosophy had been radically changed in Europe between 1150 and 1250, and these new concepts were introduced into Norway. The book Kongsspegelen was written in the 1250s, and was a guide to the education of Princes and young Noblemen, and in many ways laid the ground for the changes in Norwegian laws.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 1269 and 1281 the Norwegian and Icelandic laws were reformed, and Audun played a major part in this process, being called the "wisest man of the law" by Icelandic records. Until this time each part of Norway had their own set of "laws" or rather "judicial rulings", being aggregated at the local "tings", annual gatherings with military, religious and judicial purposes where all free male adults could (and should) take part.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the process of reforming the law 1269-1281 the King took control over the making of the laws, of judging, and of fulfilling the sentences. The Church had the same set of ambitions, and the differences between the King and Church had to be settled by the Saettargjerd of Tunsberg in 1277. The Archbishop was given extensive rights, e.g. the right to make coins. The Church reduced the amount of taxes they paid to the King, and the Church got their own jurisdiction in matters concerning morals and Christianity.[PARAGRAPH:2]A new Norwegian administrative law ("Hirdskra") was passed in 1277, and Norway adopted European customs. Changing the title of the Norwegian lendmenn to barons, being one of them. Audun was one of these new barons, and he also joined the Kings Council. For several decades he served as a lawyer ("stallare") and a treasurer ("fehirde") for the Norwegian kings Magnus and Eirik. Audun was one of the first men in Norway that built his career on his professional skills, rather than on his wealth and connections.</English>

Herzogin von Porto war Knigin von Portugal von 1826 bis 1828 und von 1834 bis 1853. Sie war die letzte Herrscherin aus dem Haus Braganza.[NEWLINE]Geboren als Maria da Glria Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga, war Maria die lteste Tochter von Peter IV. von Portugal und dessen erster Gemahlin Maria Leopoldine von sterreich. Ihr Vater hatte 1821 die brasilianische Unabhngigkeit erklrt und sich zum Kaiser Peter I. von Brasilien ausrufen lassen. 1826 erbte er zustzlich noch den portugiesischen Thron, den er als Peter IV. bestieg. Da es ihm nicht mglich war, beide Reiche Portugal und Brasilien gleichzeitig zu regieren, trat er schon nach wenigen Monaten als portugiesischer Knig zugunsten von Maria zurck. Diese bestieg so 1826 zum ersten Mal den portugiesischen Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria war zu diesem Zeitpunkt gerade sieben Jahre alt und regierte deshalb whrend ihrer ersten Herrschaftsperiode nur dem Namen nach. Ihr Vater hatte seinen jngeren Bruder, Prinz Michael, der sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt wegen seiner Opposition gegen eine konstitutionelle Monarchie in Portugal (Michael wollte absolutistisch regieren) gerade im Exil in Wien befand, zum Regenten fr Maria berufen, nachdem dieser die von Peter dem Land gegebene Verfassung, die Charta akzeptiert hatte. Spter htte sie ihren Onkel Michael heiraten und mit diesem gemeinsam das Land regieren sollen. In Wien wurde sogar eine Stellvertreterhochzeit gefeiert.[PARAGRAPH:2]Michael hatte allerdings andere Plne. Nachdem er nach Portugal zurckgekehrt war, setzte er die Charta auer Kraft, erklrte Maria II. fr abgesetzt und sich selbst zum Knig. Maria verlor so 1828 zunchst ihren Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter war nicht bereit, diesen Vertrauensbruch seines Bruders hinzunehmen. Er dankte 1831 auch als Herrscher von Brasilien ab, ging nach Europa, um dort den Kampf gegen seinen Bruder und fr den Thron seiner Tochter aufzunehmen. Es begann der Miguelistenkrieg, der 1834 mit einer Niederlage Michaels endete. Maria, seit 1833 Herzogin von Porto, wurde dadurch erneut Knigin, kurze Zeit spter starb ihr Vater, sie wurde von den Cortes fr volljhrig erklrt und begann selbstndig zu regieren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Knigin Maria II. von Portugal: Die Regierungszeit Maria II. gehrt zu den bewegtesten Perioden der portugiesischen Geschichte. Die Konstitutionalisten, also die Anhnger der konstitutionellen Monarchie, hatten sich in einen rechtsliberal-konservativen (die sog. Cartisten) und einen linksliberalen Flgel (die Setembristen) gespalten. Die Regierungszeit Marias war geprgt von der Auseinandersetzung zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen, die sogar zu einem offenen Brgerkrieg fhrte. Die Knigin stand dabei auf Seiten der Cartisten, in Zeiten, in denen die Setembristen die Oberhand hatten, untersttzte sie zum Teil offen die cartistischen Krfte (siehe Belenzada).[PARAGRAPH:2]Antnio Bernardo da Costa Cabral, der Markgraf von Tomar, war whrend ihrer Regentschaft viele Jahre Ministerprsident und regierte das Land diktatorisch. Die Knigin hielt an ihm gegen groe Widerstnde im Lande fest, was das Land an den Rand eines Brgerkriegs brachte.[PARAGRAPH:2]In erster Ehe heiratete Maria 1835 August Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg (1810-1835). Dieser verstarb bereits zwei Monate nach der Eheschlieung an der Spanischen Grippe. 1836 vermhlte sie sich in zweiter Ehe mit Ferdinand II. aus dem Haus Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha.

Whrend ihrer Regentschaft hatte sie ein exemplarisches Familienleben mit ihrem Ehemann Ferdinand von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha gefhrt. Die Knigin bedauerte oft, dass die politisch auergewhnlich turbulenten Zeiten ihr nicht gengend Zeit lieen, die sie ihrer Familie widmen konnte. Sie wurde als gutmtige Knigin und beispielhafte Ehefrau und Mutter von ihrem Volk verehrt, andererseits wegen ihrer konservativen Ansichten oft auch scharf kritisiert. Neben ihrem Festhalten an erzkonservativen Politikern wie Costa Cabral und Saldanha wurde besonders kritisiert, dass sie sich auch in ihrem Palast mit einer konservativen Kamarilla umgab, die die Handlungen der Knigin zum Teil sehr beeinflussten. Besonders in der Kritik stand hier der deutsche Erzieher ihrer Kinder, Dr. Dietz, den Ferdinand mit nach Portugal gebracht hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit der Regentschaft Maria II. endete in Portugal die Herrschaft des Hauses Braganza.

He spent much of his early life in Constantinople (actual Istanbul) as a grain merchant, looking after Venetian interests. In the late 1490s he was using his commercial correspondence for sending encoded information to Venice regarding the movements of the Turkish navy. In 1499, he was imprisoned on charges of espionage, but escaped execution due to his friendship with the vizier, and was released several years later.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the early sixteenth century, Venice lost nearly all its territory on the Italian mainland, and Gritti played an important part in the events connected with this loss and the eventual return to the status quo ante. In 1509, after the Venetian defeat at the Battle of Agnadello, Gritti was appointed as proveditor to the Venetian army in Treviso; ordered by the Council of Ten to support revolts against the invaders, he successfully engineered the return of Padua to Venetian hands, and its subsequent defence against the Emperor. In 1510, following the death of Nicolo di Pitigliano, Gritti took command of Venice's army, but was forced to withdraw to Venice by French advances. He continued as proveditor through end of the League of Cambrai and the subsequent war of the Holy League. In 1512, he led the negotiations with Francis I that resulted in Venice leaving the League and allying with France.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elected Doge in 1523, Gritti concluded a treaty with Charles V, ending Venice's active involvement in the Italian Wars. He attempted to maintain the neutrality of the Republic in the face of the continued struggle between Charles and Francis, urging both to turn their attention to the advances of the Ottoman Empire in Hungary. However, he could not prevent Suleiman I from attacking Corfu in 1537, drawing Venice into a new war with the Ottomans. His dogaressa was Benedetta Vendramin. He died in 1538.</English>

He was descended from an old Venetian noble family that played an important role in Venetian politics from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, and produced 4 Venetian doges, numerous admirals and several other prominent citizens.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dandolo was known as a benefactor of the arts. He reformed the Venetian legal code, formally proclaiming a legal framework in 1346 that compiled all of the applicable laws in the Republic. He was a friend of Petrarch's, who wrote of Dandolo that he was "a just man, incorruptible, full of ardor and love for his country, erudite, eloquent, wise, affable and human".[PARAGRAPH:2]Dandolo's rise to prominence in Venetian public life was precocious. In 1331, at the age of only 25, he was named procurator of St. Marco's Basilica. He became doge in 1343 at the age of 37.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his reign, Venice endured a disastrous war with the Hungarians following Zadar's seventh revolt against the Most Serene Republic. Allied with the Hungarians, Genoa deployed a powerful naval fleet to the Adriatic under the command of Paganino Doria that devastated the Venetian territories and threatened Venice herself. Venice was saved by the great naval victory of Lojera in 1353.</English>

Little is known of his origins, early life, or rise to power; he is mentioned in a 1219 treaty as an elder duke, and in 1236 as the leader of all the Lithuanians. The contemporary and modern sources discussing his ascent mention strategic marriages along with banishment or murder of his rivals.[PARAGRAPH:2]He extended his domain into regions southeast of Lithuania proper during the 1230s and 1240s. In 1250 or 1251, during the course of internal power struggles, he was baptised as a Roman Catholic; this action enabled him to establish an alliance with the Livonian Order, a long-standing antagonist of the Lithuanians. During the summer of 1253 he was crowned King of Lithuania, ruling between 300,000 and 400,000 subjects.[PARAGRAPH:2]While his ten-year reign was marked by various state-building accomplishments, his conflicts with relatives and other dukes continued, and western Lithuania strongly resisted the alliance's rule. His gains in the southeast were challenged by the Tatars.[PARAGRAPH:2]He broke with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew Treniota and another rival, Duke Daumantas. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder was not resolved until Traidenis gained the title of Grand Duke ca. 1270.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although his reputation was unsettled during the following centuries and his descendants were not notable, he gained standing during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mindaugas was the only King of Lithuania; while most of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes from Jogaila onward also reigned as Kings of Poland, the titles remained separate.[PARAGRAPH:2]In modern Lithuania Mindaugas is generally considered to be the founder of the Lithuanian state. He is also now credited with stopping the advance of the Tatars towards the Baltic Sea, establishing international recognition of Lithuania, and turning it towards Western civilization. In the 1990s the historian Edvardas Gudavicius published research supporting an exact coronation date - July 6, 1253. This day is now an official national holiday, Statehood Day.</English>

    <English>[H1]Vytautas the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Grand Duke of Lithuania[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1350 - October 27, 1430 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born in 1350 in the castle of present-day Senieji Trakai ("Old Trakai"), Vytautas was the son of Kestutis with his second wife Birute, cousin of Jogaila, who became King of Poland as Wladyslaw II, and grandfather of Vasili II of Russia. Vytautas' father and his uncle Algirdas, were brothers and did not compete for power. Algirdas was the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Kestutis was primarily responsible for defense against the Teutonic Knights.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila, became Grand Duke. The harmonious relationship of his father and uncle ended, and a struggle for power between them ensued. In 1380, Jogaila signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiskes with the Teutonic Knights against Kestutis. When Kestutis discovered this in the following year, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and made himself Grand Duke.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, Jogaila managed to escape and raised an army against Kestutis, and his son Vytautas. The two opposing sides confronted each other but never engaged in battle. Kestutis was ready to negotiate, but he and Vytautas were arrested and transported to Kreva Castle. One week later, Kestutis was found dead. Whether he died of natural causes or was murdered is still a matter of debate amongst historians.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1382, Vytautas was able to escape from Kreva. After the escape, he sought help from the Teutonic Knights. At the time Jogaila was negotiating with the Teutonic Order. They formulated the Treaty of Dubysa, by which Jogaila promised to accept Christianity, become an ally of the Order, and give the Order some territory of Samogitia up to the Dubysa River. However, the treaty was never ratified. In summer 1383, the war between Jogaila and the Order started up again. Vytautas participated in several raids against Jogaila.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January 1384, Vytautas again promised to cede part of Samogitia, to the Teutonic Order, up to the Nevezis River in return for the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, in July of the same year, Vytautas decided to abandon the Teutonic Knights and reconciled with Jogaila. He then proceeded to burn three important Teutonic castles, and he redeemed all Kestutis' lands, except for Trakai. Vytautas participated in the signing of Union of Kreva with Poland in 1385 and he was re-baptised in 1386 in the Catholic rite, receiving the name Alexander.[PARAGRAPH:2]This treaty provided for the marriage of Jogaila to Jadwiga of Poland, and for him to become the King of Poland. He left his brother Skirgaila as a regent of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, he was unpopular with the people and Vytautas saw an opportunity to become the Grand Duke again. In 1389 he started a war and attacked Vilnius but failed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas was forced to ask the Teutonic Knights for help for the second time in the beginning of 1390. Vytautas had to promise to keep the original agreement of 1384, and turn over Samogitia to the Order. His army now attacked Lithuanian lands. To further advance his influence, Vytautas married his only daughter Sophia to Vasili I of Russia in 1391.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Polish nobility was unhappy that Jogaila, their new king, now Wladyslaw II Jagiello, spent too much time on the affairs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was clear that the war could continue for years and would not bring any benefit to the country, thus wanted to avoid any further conflicts between Poland and Lithuania[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1398, Vytautas' army attacked a part of the Crimea and built a castle there. Now Lithuania spanned from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. A number of Tatar captives were brought to the ethnic Lithuania. Inspired by this successful campaign, Vytautas and Wladyslaw II Jagiello won support from Pope Boniface IX for organising a crusade against the Mongols. This political move also demonstrated that Grand Duchy of Lithuania had fully accepted Christianity and was defending the faith on its own, and that the Teutonic Knights had no further basis for attacks against Lithuania.[PARAGRAPH:2]The mongol campaign resulted in total defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. A number of territories revolted against Vytautas, and Smolensk was retaken by its hereditary ruler and not re-conquered by Lithuanians until 1404. In 1408 Vytautas reached peace in the east and returned to Samogitia matters.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1409 the second Samogitian uprising, backed by Vytautas, against the Teutonic Knights started. The rebels burned Skirsnemune castle. Since both Poland and Lithuania supported the rebels, the war started. Vytautas gathered a large army from 18 lands under his control. The army joined Polish forces and advanced towards the Teutonic headquarters at the castle of Marienburg (present-day Malbork). In 1410 Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald (also called the Battle of Tannenberg). The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory. Even though the siege of Marienburg was unsuccessful, the Teutonic Knights never regained their strength and from then on posed a reduced threat to Poland-Lithuania. As a result of the Peace of Thorn of 1411, Vytautas received Samogitia for his lifetime.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas was one of the creators of the Union of Horodlo with Poland in 1413. According to the act of the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to retain a separate Grand Duke and its own parliament. At the same time both the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms were to discuss all the important matters jointly. This union was important culturally as well as politically because it granted Lithuanian Christian nobles the same rights as the Polish szlachta. This act did not include Orthodox nobles. This paved the way for more contacts and cooperation between the nobles of Poland and of Lithuania.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January of 1429 Vytautas already had received the title of King of Lithuania with the backing of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, but the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by Polish magnates in autumn of 1430. Another crown was sent, but Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle several days before it reached Lithuania. He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius. The knowledge about his remains has been lost.</English>

    <English>[H1]Karl XII[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 17, 1682 - November 30, 1718 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Carl XII, Karl XII or Carolus Rex, the Alexander of the North, nicknamed in Turkish as Demirbas Sarl (Charles the Habitu?, was a King of Sweden from 1697 until his death in 1718. He was the fourth king of the Wittelsbach dynasty in Sweden. As a child, many people thought he was going to be sickly. This was proved to be wrong, though: he hardened his body for war by riding on horseback and hunting the wolves of Sweden's fir forests. When his father died, he was ready. He came to the throne at the age of fifteen and left the country three years later to embark on a series of battles overseas, that briefly made Sweden the predominant power in Northern Europe. These battles were part of the Great Northern War, and many of them were fought against Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia. His youth gave other nations a decent pretext with which to invade Sweden; Saxony, Denmark-Norway, Poland and Russia joined in a coalition to attack Sweden, beginning the Great Northern War. Charles XII turned out to be more astute than the other powers imagined, a great tactician, defeating all of the invaders. However, his strong tactical abilities were not accompanied by strategic and political wisdom. He is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the Great Northern War, "I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies." He took this resolution to an extreme level, which eventually resulted in the end of the Swedish Empire and its dominance of the southern Baltic Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles's first campaign was against Denmark, ruled by his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark, which threatened a Swedish ally, Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp (another cousin of Charles XII, and married to his sister Hedvig Sophia). Denmark's defeat, however, and Sweden's ensuing rise to prominence in the Baltic region was viewed suspiciously by two powerful neighbors, King August II of Poland (cousin to both Charles XII and Frederick IV of Denmark) and Peter the Great of Russia. Russia responded by occupying the Swedish territories of Livonia and Estonia. Charles countered this by attacking the Russian garrison at Battle of Narva. From the very beginning, this seemed to be a headstrong move. The Swedish army of ten thousand men was outnumbered four to one by the Russians. Still, Charles attacked under cover of a blizzard, and effectively split the Russian army in two. Many of Peter's troops that fled the battlefield drowned in the Narva River and the battle was a crushing Swedish victory.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles, despite advice from his advisors, didn't pursue the Russian army. Instead, he then turned against Poland-Lithuania, which was formally neutral at this point, disregarding Polish negotiation proposals, supported by the Swedish parliament. Charles defeated Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702 and captured many important cities of the Commonwealth. After the deposition of the king of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII filled the void with his own man, Stanislas Leszczynski .[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, while Charles enjoyed easy victories in the Commonwealth, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great embarked on a giant military reform plan that soon begun to bear fruit. The new Russian army was a much tougher one than the one defeated at Narva. Russian forces had managed to retake Livonia and even established a new city Saint Petersburg there. This prompted Charles to make the fatal decision to attack the Russian heartland with an assault on Moscow, allying himself with Ivan Mazepa, ataman of the Cossacks. Peter the Great managed to cripple Swedish forces near the Baltic coast before Charles managed to combine his forces, and Charles' Polish ally, Stanislaw Leszczynski, was facing internal problems of his own. Charles expected the support of a massive Cossack rebellion led by Mazepa in Ukraine but the Russians destroyed the rebel army before they could aid the Swedes. The harsh climate took its toll as well, as Charles marched his troops through Ukraine. By the time of the decisive Battle of Poltava, Charles had been wounded, one-third of his infantry was dead, and his vulnerable supply train destroyed. The king himself, incapacitated by a coma resulting from his injuries, was unable to rally the Swedish forces. The battle was a disaster, and Charles fled south to the Ottoman Empire, where he set up camp at Bender with about 1000 men who were called Caroleans ("Karoliner" in Swedish). The Poltava Swedish disaster marked both the end of the Swedish Empire and the rise of Russian Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Turks initially welcomed the Swedish king, who managed to incite a war between the Ottomans and the Russians. However the sultan Ahmed III eventually tired of Charles' endless scheming and ordered his arrest. Meanwhile, the king's old enemies Russia and Poland took advantage of his absence to regain and even expand their lost territories. England, an ally of the Swedes, defected from their alliance obligations while the Prussians also attacked Swedish holdings in Germany. Russia seized Finland and Augustus II regained the Polish throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Seeing his very kingdom threatened, Charles fled the Ottoman Empire and rode across Europe in just fifteen days to return to Swedish Pomerania. His efforts to reestablish his lost empire failed, however, when he was killed by a bullet during his second siege of the fortress Fredriksten in Danish-controlled Norway. There has been some speculations that he was not killed by a stray bullet but by one fired from the Swedish side, making his death an assassination (at the time he was not very popular in Sweden due to the hardships the people suffered because of the constant wars) but a conclusion has never been reached. He was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleanora.[PARAGRAPH:2]His death is one of countless trivial disagreements between Norway and Sweden, both sides claiming the kill. It is not uncommon for the Norwegian media to end articles concerning Sweden with the line PS: We shot Charles XII![PARAGRAPH:2]Exceptional for abstaining from alcohol and women, he felt most comfortable during warfare. Contemporaries report of his seemingly inhuman tolerance for pain and his utter lack of emotion. The king brought Sweden to its pinnacle of prestige and power through his brilliant campaigning. However, his over-ambitious invasion of Russia coupled with the overwhelming power of a revived anti-Swedish coalition brought Sweden's downfall as a Great Power.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apart from being a monarch, the King's interests included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is attributed to having invented an octal numeral system, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because of all cubic boxes used for materials such as gunpowder. According to a report by contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched down a model of his thought on a piece of paper and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later, but has since been lost. Several historians of science suspect that either the multi-talented Emanuel Swedenborg or the brilliant inventor Christopher Polhem also present at the meeting in Lund 1716 may have been the true inventor behind this feat, or at least a main contributor.</English>

     <Chinese>[H1]卡尔十二世[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]瑞典国王[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生活于1682年6月17日至公元1718年11月30日[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB Carl十二世，卡尔十二世或卡罗卢斯雷克斯，北方亚历山大，在土耳其语中昵称为德米尔巴斯萨尔（查尔斯・哈比图？），1697年至1718年去世，一直是瑞典国王。他是瑞典维特尔斯巴赫王朝的第四位国王。当他还是个孩子时，许多人认为他会生病。但事实证明，这是错误的：他骑马和猎杀瑞典冷杉林的狼，使自己的身体变得强壮，以备战争之需。当他的父亲他在十五岁时登上王位，三年后离开该国，开始了一系列海外战争，这使瑞典短暂地成为北欧的主导力量。这些战争是伟大的北方战争的一部分，其中许多是与俄罗斯皇帝彼得大帝（Peter Great）的战争为其他国家入侵瑞典提供了正当的借口；萨克森州、丹麦、挪威、波兰和俄罗斯加入了攻打瑞典的联盟，开始了北方大战争。查理十二世被证明比其他国家想象的更机敏，是一位伟大的战术家，击败了所有入侵者。然而，他强大的战术能力却没有得到充分的发挥伏尔泰引用他的话说，在北方大战争爆发时，“我决心绝不发动不公正的战争，但绝不结束合法的战争，除非打败我的敌人。”他将这项决议发挥到了极致，最终导致瑞典帝国的灭亡及其对波罗的海南部的统治。[PARAGRAPH:2]查尔斯的第一次战役是反对丹麦，由他的表兄丹麦弗雷德里克四世统治，威胁到了瑞典盟友荷尔斯泰因哥特托普的弗雷德里克四世（查尔斯十二世的另一个表亲，与他的妹妹赫德维格・索菲亚结婚）。然而，丹麦的失败以及瑞典随后在波罗的海地区的崛起被两个强大的邻国――波兰国王奥古斯特二世（查尔斯十二世和丹麦弗雷德里克四世的表亲）怀疑地看待还有俄罗斯的彼得大帝。俄罗斯占领了瑞典的利沃尼亚和爱沙尼亚领土作为回应。查尔斯在纳尔瓦战役中袭击了俄罗斯驻军作为反击。从一开始，这似乎是一个任性的举动。瑞典一万人的军队被俄国人以四比一的比例击败。然而，查尔斯・阿特在暴风雪的掩护下被击溃，有效地将俄罗斯军队一分为二。逃离战场的彼得的许多军队在纳尔瓦河中溺水身亡，这场战斗是瑞典的一次压倒性胜利。[PARAGRAPH:2]查尔斯不顾他的顾问们的建议，没有追随俄罗斯军队。相反，他转而反对波兰-立陶宛，波兰-立陶宛在这一点上是正式中立的，无视得到瑞典议会支持的波兰谈判建议。1702年，查尔斯在克利苏夫战役中击败了波兰国王奥古斯都二世及其撒克逊盟友，并于2007年在卡普岛战役中击败了波兰国王奥古斯都二世在波兰-立陶宛联邦国王宣誓就职后，查理十二世用他自己的人斯坦尼斯拉斯・莱斯茨钦斯基填补了这一空缺。[PARAGRAPH:2]与此同时，当查尔斯在英联邦轻松获胜时，俄罗斯沙皇彼得大帝开始实施一项巨大的军事改革计划，该计划很快开始产生成果。新的俄罗斯军队比在纳尔瓦被击败的军队要强硬得多。俄罗斯军队成功夺回了利沃尼亚，甚至在那里建立了一座新的城市圣彼得堡。这促使查尔斯做出了致命的决定，与哥萨克的阿塔曼伊万・马泽帕结盟，攻击俄罗斯的心脏地带，攻击莫斯科。彼得大帝在查尔斯联合他的军队之前，成功地削弱了波罗的海沿岸的瑞典军队，而查尔斯的波兰盟友斯坦尼斯劳・莱斯茨钦斯基也面临着他自己的内部问题。查尔斯希望得到由马泽帕领导的乌克兰大规模哥萨克叛乱的支持，但俄国人在援助瑞典人之前摧毁了叛军。恶劣的气候也造成了损失，查尔斯率领军队穿越乌克兰。到波尔塔瓦决战时，查尔斯已经受伤，三分之一的步兵死亡，脆弱的补给火车被毁。国王本人因受伤而昏迷，无法召集瑞典军队。这场战斗是一场灾难，查尔斯向南逃到奥斯曼帝国，在那里他在本德建立了营地，约有1000人被称为卡罗琳人（在瑞典语中称为“卡罗琳人”）。波尔塔瓦-瑞典灾难标志着瑞典帝国的终结和俄罗斯帝国的崛起。[PARAGRAPH:2]土耳其人最初欢迎瑞典国王，他成功地煽动了奥斯曼帝国和俄罗斯之间的战争。然而，苏丹艾哈迈德三世最终厌倦了查尔斯没完没了的阴谋，下令逮捕他。与此同时，国王的宿敌俄罗斯和波兰利用国王的缺席收复甚至扩大了他们失去的领土。瑞典人的盟友英国背叛了他们的联盟义务，而普鲁士人也攻击了瑞典人在德国的财产。俄国占领了芬兰，奥古斯都二世夺回了波兰王位。[PARAGRAPH:2]看到自己的王国受到威胁，查尔斯逃离了奥斯曼帝国，在短短十五天内骑马穿越欧洲回到瑞典博美拉尼亚。然而，当他在丹麦控制的挪威第二次围攻弗雷德里克斯滕要塞时被子弹打死，他重建失去的帝国的努力失败了。有人猜测他不是被流弹打死的，而是被瑞典方面发射的一颗子弹打死的，这使得他的死成为了一次暗杀（当时他在瑞典不是很受欢迎，因为瑞典人民因不断的战争而遭受苦难），但从未得出结论。他的姐姐乌尔丽卡・埃莉诺拉继承了他的瑞典王位。[PARAGRAPH:2]他的死是挪威和瑞典之间无数琐碎的分歧之一，双方都声称是他杀。挪威媒体在有关瑞典的文章结尾用“PS:我们枪杀了查理十二世”这句话，这并不少见！[PARAGRAPH:2]除了戒酒和女人，他在战争中感觉最舒服。同时代的人报告说，他对痛苦的容忍似乎不人道，他完全没有感情。国王通过他出色的竞选活动将瑞典带到了其威望和权力的顶峰。然而，他雄心勃勃地入侵俄罗斯，再加上反瑞典联盟重新崛起的压倒性力量，导致瑞典作为一个大国的衰落。[PARAGRAPH:2]除了作为一个君主，国王的利益还包括数学，以及任何有利于其战争目的的东西。他被认为发明了一种八进制数字系统，他认为这种系统更适合用于战争目的，因为所有的立方体盒子都用于制造火药等材料。根据当代科学家伊曼纽尔・斯维登堡（Emanuel Swedenborg）的一份报告，国王在一张纸上画下了他的思想模型，并在1716年隆德的会议上交给了他。据报道，这张纸在100年后仍然存在，但后来就丢失了。一些科学史学家怀疑，多才多艺的伊曼纽尔・斯维登堡（Emanuel Swedenborg）或杰出的发明家克里斯托弗・波勒姆（Christopher Polhem）可能是这一壮举背后的真正发明家，或者至少是主要贡献者。

    <English>[H1]Harun Al-Rashid[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Khalif of Baghdad[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 763 - 809 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Harun al-Rashid (also spelled Harun ar-Rashid, Haroun al-Rashid or Haroon al Rasheed; English: Aaron the Upright, Aaron the Just, or Aaron the Rightly-Guided) was the fifth and most famous Abbasid Caliph. Ruling from 786 until 809, his was a time of scientific, cultural, and religious prosperity. Art and music also flourished significantly during his reign. His life and his fabulous court over which he held sway has been the subject of many tales, some of them facts but most are believed to be fictitious. The famous The Book of One Thousand and One Nights contained many stories that might have been inspired by Harun's magnificent court. [PARAGRAPH:2] Harun was the son of al-Mahdi, the third 'Abbasid caliph (ruled 775-785), and al-Khayzuran, a former slave girl from Yemen and a woman of strong personality who greatly influenced affairs of state in the reigns of her husband and sons. Harun became caliph when he was in his early twenties. On the day of accession, his son al-Ma'mun was born, and al-Amin some little time later: the latter was the son of Zubaida, a granddaughter of al-Mansur (founder of the city of Baghdad); so he took precedence over the former, whose mother was a Persian slave-girl. He began his reign by appointing very able ministers, who carried on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved the condition of the people. [PARAGRAPH:2] It was under Harun ar-Rashid that Baghdad flourished into the most splendid city of its period. Tribute was paid by many rulers to the caliph, and these funds were used on architecture, the arts and a luxurious life at court. Harun gave great encouragement to learning, poetry and music. He was a scholar and poet himself and whenever he heard of learned men in his own kingdom, or in neighboring countries, he invited them to his court and treated them with respect. The name of Harun, therefore, became known throughout the world. He had diplomatic relations with China and with Charlemagne. [PARAGRAPH:2] In military matters, Harun was an excellent soldier and showed this ability at a young age when his father was still caliph. He later commanded an army of 95,000 Arabs and Persians sent by his father to invade the Byzantine Empire, formerly the Eastern Roman Empire, which was then ruled by the Empress Irene. After defeating Irene's famous general, Nicetas, Harun marched his army to Chrysopolis (now Uskudar in Turkey) on the Asiatic coast, opposite Constantinople. Irene agreed to pay tribute if Arabs left. The tribute of gold that the Empress Irene agreed to pay Harun was sent regularly for many years. It was always received at Baghdad with great ceremony. The day on which it arrived was made a holiday. The Byzantine soldiers who came with it entered the gates in procession. Muslim troops also took part in the parade. When the gold had been delivered at the palace, the Byzantine soldiers were hospitably entertained, and were escorted to the main gate of the city when they set out on their journey back to Constantinople.</English>

    <Chinese>[H1]哈伦・拉希德[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]巴格达的哈利夫[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]居住：[\BOLD]763-809[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]哈伦・拉希德（也拼写为哈伦・拉希德、哈伦・拉希德或哈龙・拉希德；英文：正直的亚伦、正义的亚伦或正确引导的亚伦）是第五位也是最著名的阿巴斯哈里发。从786年到809年，他的统治时期是科学、文化和宗教繁荣的时期。在他的统治时期，艺术和音乐也非常繁荣。他的生活和他所统治的神话般的宫廷一直是许多故事的主题，其中一些是事实，但大多数被认为是虚构的。著名的《一千零一夜之书》中包含了许多故事，这些故事可能是受到哈伦宏伟宫廷的启发。[PARAGRAPH:2]哈伦是第三任“阿巴斯哈里发”（统治时期为775-785年）迈赫迪和前也门女奴哈扎兰的儿子，她性格坚强，在丈夫和儿子的统治时期对国家事务产生了重大影响。哈伦在二十出头时成为哈里发。在登基那天，他的儿子al-Ma'mun出生了，不久之后，al-Amin出生了：后者是al-Mansur（巴格达市创始人）孙女祖拜达的儿子；因此，他优先于前者，后者的母亲是一名波斯女奴。他通过任命非常能干的部长开始了他的统治，部长们出色地完成了政府的工作，极大地改善了人民的状况。[PARAGRAPH:2]正是在哈伦・阿尔・拉希德（Harun ar Rashid）的领导下，巴格达发展成为当时最辉煌的城市。许多统治者向哈里发进贡，这些资金用于建筑、艺术和宫廷奢华生活。哈伦对学习、诗歌和音乐给予了极大的鼓励。他本人就是一位学者和诗人，每当他在自己的王国或邻国听说有学者时，他都会邀请他们到他的宫廷里来，并对他们表示尊敬。因此，哈伦的名字在全世界广为人知。他与中国和查理曼大帝都有外交关系。[PARAGRAPH:2]在军事方面，哈伦是一名优秀的士兵，在他父亲还是哈里发的时候就表现出了这种能力。后来，他指挥一支由他父亲派遣的95000名阿拉伯人和波斯人组成的军队入侵拜占庭帝国，前身为东罗马帝国，当时由艾琳皇后统治。在击败艾琳的著名将军尼塞塔斯后，哈伦将他的军队开往亚洲海岸的克里索波利斯（现在土耳其的乌斯库达尔），与君士坦丁堡相对。如果阿拉伯人离开，艾琳同意向他们致敬。艾琳皇后同意向哈伦献上的黄金贡品多年来一直定期送出。它总是在巴格达受到隆重的欢迎。它到达的那天被定为假日。随行的拜占庭士兵列队进入城门。穆斯林军队也参加了游行。当黄金被送到宫殿时，拜占庭士兵受到了热情款待，并在返回君士坦丁堡的旅途中被护送到城门。</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]Bla III[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Hungary and Croatia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1148 - April 23, 1196[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Bla III  was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1172 and 1196. He was the second son of King Gza II and Gza's wife, Euphrosyne of Kiev. Around 1161, Euphrosyne granted Bla a duchy, which included Croatia, central Dalmatia and possibly Sirmium. In accordance with a peace treaty between his elder brother, Stephen III, who succeeded their father in 1162, and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, Bla moved to Constantinople in 1163. He was renamed to Alexios, and the emperor granted him the newly created senior court title of despotes. He was betrothed to the Emperor's daughter, Maria. Bla's patrimony caused armed conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary between 1164 and 1167, because Stephen III attempted to hinder the Byzantines from taking control of Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. Bla-Alexios, who was designated as Emperor Manuel's heir in 1165, took part in three Byzantine campaigns against Hungary. His betrothal to the emperor's daughter was dissolved after her brother, Alexios, was born in 1169. The emperor deprived Bla of his high title, granting him the inferior rank of kaisar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, and Bla decided to return to Hungary. Before his departure, he pledged that he would never make war against the Byzantine Empire. Although the Hungarian prelates and lords unanimously proclaimed Bla king, Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom opposed his coronation because of Bla's alleged simony. Finally, the Archbishop of Kalocsa crowned him king on 18 January 1173, with Pope Alexander III's approval. Bla fought with his younger brother, Gza, whom he held in captivity for more than a decade. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Byzantine Empire after Emperor Manuel's death, Bla reoccupied Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium between 1180 and 1181. He occupied the Principality of Halych in 1188, but it was lost within two years.</English>

He led Sweden to military supremacy during the Thirty Years War, helping to determine the political as well as the religious balance of power in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]He is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, with innovative use of combined arms. His most notable military victory was the Battle of Breitenfeld. With a superb military machine with good weapons, excellent training, and effective field artillery, backed by an efficient government which could provide necessary funds, Gustavus Adolphus was poised to make himself a major European leader, but he was killed at the Battle of Ltzen in 1632. He was ably assisted in his efforts by Count Axel Oxenstierna, the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, who also acted as regent after his death.[PARAGRAPH:2]In an era characterized by almost endless warfare, he led his armies as king from 1611 (at age 16) until his death in battle in 1632 while leading a charge-as Sweden rose from the status of a mere regional power and run-of-the-mill kingdom to one of the great powers of Europe and a model of early modern era government. Within only a few years of his accession, Sweden had become the largest nation in Europe after Russia and Spain. Some have called him the "father of modern warfare", or the first great modern general. Under his tutelage, Sweden and the Protestant cause developed a number of excellent commanders, such as Lennart Torstensson, who would go on to defeat Sweden's enemies and expand the boundaries and the power of the empire long after Gustavus Adolphus' death in battle.</English>

    <English>[H1]Basil II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Byzantine Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]958-1025[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Basil was the son of Emperor Romanos II by Theophano, whose family was of Armenian descent. In 960, he was associated on the throne by his father, but the latter died in 963, when Basil was only five years old. Because he and his brother, the future Emperor Constantine VIII (ruled 1025-1028), were too young to reign in their own right, Basil's mother Theophano married one of Romanos' leading generals, who took the throne as the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas several months later in 963. Nikephoros was murdered in 969, only to be succeeded by another general, who became Emperor John I Tzimisces and reigned for seven years. Finally, when John died on January 10, 976, Basil II took the throne as senior emperor.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil was a brave soldier and a superb horseman; he was to prove himself a strong ruler and an able general. He did not at first display the full extent of his energy. In the early years of his reign, the administration remained in the hands of the eunuch Basil Lekapenos (an illegitimate son of Emperor Romanos I), president of the senate, a wily and gifted man, who hoped that the young emperors would be his puppet. Basil waited and watched without interfering, and devoted himself to learning the details of administrative business and instructing himself in military science.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Nikephoros II Phokas in particular had proven to be a brilliant military commander during his reign, both he and John I Tzimiskes had proven to be lax administrators. Although John had reportedly planned to curb the power of the landowners at the end of his reign, his death soon after speaking out against them led to his reported poisoning. As a result, Basil found himself with a serious problem as soon as his reign began. The great landowners of Asia Minor, Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas - who provided many of the empire's soldiers and taxes - were in open revolt against the empire. Basil, showing the penchant for ruthlessness that would become his trademark, took the field himself and suppressed the rebellions of both Skleros (979) and Phokas (989).[PARAGRAPH:2]Having put an end to the internal strife, Basil II then turned his attention to the empire's other enemies. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the empire's position in the east and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch threatened by the enemy. In the 995, Basil II with an army of 40,000 men (with 80,000 mules), launched a campaign against the Muslim Arabs and won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south, sacking all of the cities from Emesa to Tripoli. Although he did not have sufficient forces to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire. No emperor since Heraclius had been able to hold these lands for any length of time, and they would remain Byzantine for the next 75 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil also wanted to restore to the empire territories that it had long lost. At the start of the second millennium, he took on his greatest adversary, Samuil of Bulgaria, who also was of Armenian descent. Bulgaria had been partly subjugated by John I Tzimiskes, but parts of the country had remained outside Byzantine control, under the leadership of Samuil and his brothers. As they raided Byzantine lands starting from 976, the Byzantine government sought to cause dissention by first allowing the escape of the captive emperor Boris II of Bulgaria. This having failed, Basil used a respite from his conflict with the nobility to lead an army of 60,000 men into Bulgaria and besiege Sredets (Sofia) in 986. Taking losses and worried about the loyalty of some of his governors, Basil lifted the siege and headed back for Thrace but fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at Trajan's Gate at the Battle of Trayanovi Vrata.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil escaped with the help of his Varangian Guard and attempted to make up his losses by turning Samuil's brother Aron against him. Aron was tempted with Basil's offer of his own sister Anna in marriage, but the negotiations failed when Aron discovered that the bride he was sent was a fake. By 987 Aron had been eliminated by Samuil, and Basil was busy fighting both Skleros and Phokas in Asia Minor. Although the titular emperor Roman of Bulgaria was captured in 991, Basil lost Moesia to the Bulgarians. In 992, Basil II concluded a treaty with Pietro Orseolo II by the terms that Venice's custom duties in Constantinople would be reduced from 30 nomismata to 17 nomismata in return for the Venetians agreeing to transport Byzantine troops to southern Italy in times of war.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1000, Basil II was able to focus on his war with Bulgaria again. Samuil had extended his rule from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea and raided into central Greece, and Basil was determined to reverse the fortunes of the empire. In 1001-1002, the Byzantines were able to regain control of Moesia, and in 1003 he raided into Macedonia, taking Skopje. In 1005, the governor of Durazzo surrendered his city to the Byzantines. During the next several years, the Byzantines failed to make any significant gains.[PARAGRAPH:2]Finally, on July 29, 1014, Basil II outmaneuvered the Bulgarian army in the Battle of Kleidion, with Samuil separated from his force. Having crushed the Bulgarians, Basil was said to have captured 15,000 prisoners and blinded 99 of every 100 men, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their ruler, who fainted at the sight and died two days later suffering a stroke. Although this may be an exaggeration, this gave Basil his nickname Boulgaroktonos, "the Bulgar-slayer" in later tradition.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bulgaria fought on for four more years, but finally submitted in 1018. This victory and the later submission of the Serbs fulfilled one of Basil's goals, as the empire regained its ancient Danube River frontier for the first time in 400 years. Before returning to Constantinople, Basil II celebrated his triumph in Athens.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil II returned in triumph to Constantinople, then promptly went east and attacked the Persians over control of Armenia, which had become a Byzantine tributary when its king died in 1000. More victories followed, and Armenia rejoined the Byzantine empire for the first time in two centuries. Basil created in those highlands a strongly fortified frontier, which, if his successors had been capable, should have proved an effective barrier against the invasions of the Seljuk Turks.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the meantime, other Byzantine forces restored much of Southern Italy, lost over the previous 150 years, to the empire's control. When Basil finally died on December 15, 1025, he was planning a military expedition to recover the island of Sicily.</English>

     <Chinese>[H1]巴兹尔二世[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]拜占庭皇帝[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]在世：[\BOLD]958-1025[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]巴兹尔是塞奥法诺（Theophano）的罗马诺斯二世皇帝之子，其家族为亚美尼亚后裔。960年，他的父亲将他与国王联系在一起，但后者于963年去世，当时巴兹尔只有5岁。因为他和他的兄弟，未来的君士坦丁八世皇帝（统治1025-1028年），还太年轻，无法独立统治，巴兹尔的母亲西奥法诺嫁给了罗马诺斯的一位主要将领，他在963年几个月后继承了尼科弗罗斯二世・福卡斯的王位。Nikephoros于969年被谋杀，后来被另一位将军继任，他成为了皇帝约翰一世・齐米西斯并统治了七年。最后，当约翰于976年1月10日去世时，巴兹尔二世作为高级皇帝继承了王位。[PARAGRAPH:2]巴兹尔是一名勇敢的士兵和一名出色的骑手；他要证明自己是一位强有力的统治者和一位能干的将军。起初，他没有充分发挥自己的精力。在他统治的早期，政府仍然掌握在太监巴兹尔・莱卡普诺斯（罗曼诺斯一世皇帝的私生子）手中，他是参议院议长，是一个狡猾而有天赋的人，希望年轻的皇帝成为他的傀儡。巴兹尔耐心地等待和观察，并致力于学习行政事务的细节，并自学军事科学。[PARAGRAPH:2]尽管Nikephoros II Phokas在其统治期间被证明是一位杰出的军事指挥官，事实证明，他和约翰・齐米斯基都是松懈的管理者。尽管据报道约翰曾计划在其统治结束时遏制地主的权力，但他在公开反对地主后不久死亡，导致据报道他中毒。因此，巴兹尔一开始统治，就发现自己面临着一个严重的问题。小亚细亚的大地主巴达斯・斯克洛斯（Bardas Skleros）和巴达斯・福卡斯（Bardas Phokas）――他们提供了帝国的许多士兵和税收――公开反抗帝国。巴兹尔表现出残忍的嗜好，这将成为他的标志，他亲自占领了战场，镇压了斯克洛斯（979）和福卡斯（989）的叛乱。[PARAGRAPH:2]结束了内部冲突后，巴兹尔二世将注意力转向了帝国的其他敌人。拜占庭内战削弱了帝国在东部的地位，Nikephoros II Phokas和John I Tzimiskes的战绩几近失利，阿勒颇被包围，安提俄克受到敌人的威胁。在995年，巴兹尔二世率领一支4万人的军队（8万头骡子）发动了一场针对穆斯林阿拉伯人的战役，并在叙利亚赢得了几场战役，解救了阿勒颇，占领了奥伦特斯山谷，并进一步向南袭击，洗劫了从埃梅萨到的黎波里的所有城市。尽管他没有足够的兵力开进巴勒斯坦并收回耶路撒冷，但他的胜利确实让叙利亚的大部分地区恢复了帝国。自赫拉克利乌斯以来，没有一位皇帝能够长期拥有这些土地，在接下来的75年里，这些土地仍将是拜占庭式的。[PARAGRAPH:2]巴兹尔还希望恢复其长期失去的帝国领土。在第二个千年伊始，他与他最大的对手保加利亚的萨缪尔交锋，萨缪尔也是亚美尼亚人后裔。保加利亚部分被约翰・齐米斯克征服，但在萨缪尔及其兄弟的领导下，该国部分地区仍处于拜占庭式的控制之外。当他们从976年开始袭击拜占庭的土地时，拜占庭政府试图通过首先允许被俘的保加利亚皇帝鲍里斯二世逃跑来引起异议。这一行动失败后，巴兹尔利用与贵族冲突的喘息机会，率领一支6万人的军队进入保加利亚，并于986年包围了苏菲亚的斯雷德茨。巴兹尔遭受了损失，并担心他的一些州长的忠诚，解除了围困，返回色雷斯，但在特拉亚诺维-瓦拉塔战役中陷入伏击，在图拉真城门惨败。[PARAGRAPH:2]巴兹尔在他的瓦兰吉安守卫的帮助下逃跑，并试图通过让萨缪尔的兄弟阿隆反对他来弥补他的损失。巴兹尔向阿伦求婚，阿伦很受诱惑，但谈判失败了，因为阿伦发现送他的新娘是假的。到987年，阿隆被萨缪尔消灭，巴兹尔忙于在小亚细亚与斯克洛斯和福卡斯作战。虽然名义上的保加利亚罗马皇帝于991年被俘虏，但巴兹尔却将莫西亚输给了保加利亚人。公元992年，巴兹尔二世与彼得罗・奥西奥洛二世签订了一项条约，规定威尼斯在君士坦丁堡的关税将从30诺米斯马减少到17诺米斯马，以换取威尼斯人同意在战时将拜占庭军队运到意大利南部，巴兹尔二世能够再次专注于他与保加利亚的战争。萨缪尔将他的统治从亚得里亚海延伸到黑海，并袭击了希腊中部，巴兹尔决心扭转帝国的命运。1001-1002年，拜占庭人重新控制了摩西亚，并于1003年突袭马其顿，攻占斯科普里。1005年，杜拉佐总督向拜占庭人投降。在接下来的几年中，拜占庭人没有取得任何重大进展。[PARAGRAPH:2]最后，在1014年7月29日，巴兹尔二世在克莱顿战役中击败了保加利亚军队，萨缪尔与他的部队分离。在镇压保加利亚人之后，据说巴兹尔俘虏了15000名囚犯，使每100人中的99人失明，留下150名独眼人带他们回到他们的统治者身边，这位统治者一看见就晕倒，两天后死于中风。虽然这可能有点夸张，但这给了巴兹尔一个绰号，即后来的传统中的“保加利亚杀手”。[PARAGRAPH:2]保加利亚又战斗了四年，但最终于1018年投降。这一胜利以及后来塞族人的屈服实现了巴兹尔的目标之一，因为帝国400年来首次收复了其古老的多瑙河边界。在回到君士坦丁堡之前，巴兹尔二世在雅典庆祝了他的胜利。[PARAGRAPH:2]巴兹尔二世凯旋回到君士坦丁堡，然后迅速向东进攻波斯人对亚美尼亚的控制权，亚美尼亚在1000年国王去世时成为拜占庭的一个支流。随后又取得了更多的胜利，亚美尼亚两个世纪以来第一次重新加入拜占庭帝国。巴兹尔在这些高地上建立了一个坚固的边境，如果他的继任者有能力的话，这应该是抵御塞尔柱土耳其人入侵的有效屏障。[PARAGRAPH:2]与此同时，其他拜占庭军队将意大利南部在过去150年中失去的大部分地区恢复到帝国的控制之下。当巴兹尔最终于1025年12月15日去世时，他正计划进行一次军事远征，以收回西西里岛。</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]Mieszko I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Duke of Poland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 940 - May 25, 992[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Mieszko I was the ruler of the Polans from about 960 until his death. A member of the Piast dynasty, he was a son of Siemomysl, a grandchild of Lestek, the father of Boleslaw I the Brave (the first crowned king of Poland), the likely father of Sigrid the Haughty (a Nordic Queen) and the grandfather of Cnut the Great (Sigrid's son).[PARAGRAPH:2]The first historical ruler of Poland, Mieszko I is considered the de facto creator of the Polish state. He continued the policy of both his father and grandfather, who were rulers of the pagan tribes located in the area of present Greater Poland. Either through alliances or by use of military force, Mieszko extended the ongoing conquests and early in his reign subordinated Kuyavia and probably Gdansk Pomerania and Masovia. For most of his reign, Mieszko I was involved in warfare for the control of Western Pomerania, eventually conquering it up to the vicinity of the lower Oder. During the last years of his life he fought the Bohemian state, winning Silesia and probably Lesser Poland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mieszko I's marriage in 965 to the Czech Premyslid princess Dobrawa and his baptism in 966 put him and his country in the cultural sphere of Western Christianity. Apart from the great conquests accomplished during his reign (which proved to be fundamental for the future of Poland), Mieszko I was renowned for his internal reforms, aimed at expanding and improving the so-called war monarchy system.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to existing sources, Mieszko I was a wise politician, a talented military leader and charismatic ruler. He successfully used diplomacy, concluding an alliance with Bohemia first, and then with Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire. In foreign policy, he placed the interests of his country foremost, even entering into agreements with former enemies. On his death, he left to his sons a country of greatly expanded territory, with a well-established position in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mieszko I also enigmatically appeared as "Dagome" in a papal document dating to about 1085, called Dagome iudex, which mentions a gift or dedication of Mieszko's land to the Pope (the act took place almost a hundred years earlier).</English>

His predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks but from 1190 onward Philip styled himself king of France. The son of Louis VII and of his third wife, Adela of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed "God-given" because he was the first son of Louis VII and born late in his father's life.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a twelve year struggle with the Plantagenet dynasty, Philip broke up the large Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals (German, Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while the English king was forced by his barons to sign the Magna Carta and faced a rebellion in which Philip intervened, the First Barons' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip did not directly participate in the Albigensian Crusade, but he allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out, preparing the subsequent expansion of France southward.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip was nicknamed "Augustus" by the chronicler Rigord for having remarkably extended the royal demesne, the domains ruled directly by the kings of France, as opposed to the territories ruled indirectly by vassals of the king.[PARAGRAPH:2]He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns to free themselves from seigniorial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent Bourgeoisie. He built a great wall around Paris, reorganized the government and brought financial stability to the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip Augustus transformed France from a small feudal state into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. He died in 1223 and was succeeded by his son, Louis VIII. Knowing his own declining health would inevitably decrease his political strength, he was the first Capetian king not to have his eldest son anointed to act as co-ruler during his lifetime; instead his son acted as sole king.</English>

    <English>[H1]Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host; Leader of Ukrainian Cossacks[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1595 - 6 August 1657[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]In Ukraine, Khmelnytsky is generally regarded as a national hero and a father of the nation. A city and a region of the country bear his name. His image is prominently displayed on Ukrainian banknotes and his monument in the centre of Kiev is the focal point of the Ukrainian capital. There have also been several issues of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, one of the highest decorations in Ukraine and in the former Soviet Union. With all this positive appreciation of his legacy, even in Ukraine it is far from being unanimous. He is mostly criticised for his union with Russia, which - in the view of some - proved to be disastrous for the future of the country. This particular view, among others, was expressed by a prominent Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko, who was one of Khmelnytsky's very vocal and harsh critics. Furthermore his local reputation was damaged by his alliance with the Crimean Tatars, which permitted the latter to take a large number of Ukrainian peasants as slaves (this may be interpreted as an illustration of the relative indifference of the cossacks as a military caste toward the 'kholopy', the lowest stratum of the Ukrainian people). The traces of this are still found in folk songs. On the balance, the view of his legacy in present-day Ukraine is more positive than negative, with some critics admitting that the union with Russia was dictated by necessity and an attempt to survive in those difficult times.[PARAGRAPH:2]In their assessment of Khmelnytsky's legacy the official Russian historiography stressed the fact that Khmelnytsky entered into union with Moscow's Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich with an expressed desire to "re-unify" Ukraine with Russia. This view corresponded with the official theory of Moscow being an heir of the Kievan Rus' and thus a gatherer of its former territories. In this light Khmelnytsky was viewed as a national hero of Russia for bringing Ukraine into the "eternal union" of all the Russias - Great, Little and White Russia. As such, he was much respected and venerated in Imperial Russia. His role was presented as a model for all Ukrainians to follow, to aspire for closer ties with Great Russia. This view was expressed in a monument commissioned by the Russian nationalist Mikhail Yuzefovich, which was installed in the center of Kiev in 1888. The original variant of the monument (created by Russian sculptor Mikhail Mikeshin) appeared too xenophobic for the Russian authorities, as it was to depict a vanquished Pole, Jew, and a Catholic priest under the hoofs of the horse. A more moderate version was installed, but the inscription on the monument read "To Bohdan Khmelnitsky from one and indivisible Russia." The view of Khmelnytsky as a prominent, positive figure in the Russian history is further displayed in Mikeshin's Monument to the Millennium of Russia in Novgorod, where Khmelnytsky is shown as one of Russia's prominent figures. Soviet historiography followed in many ways the Imperial Russian theory of re-unification while adding the class struggle dimension to the story. Thus, Khmelnytsky was not only praised for re-unifying Ukraine with Russia, but also for organizing the class struggle of oppressed Ukrainian peasants against Polish exploiters.</English>

He also enjoyed the support of a powerful Andalusian family who later became political rivals, the Ashqilula. Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Ashqilula al-Tujibi assisted Mohammed's rise to power in Arjona in 1232. Mohammed forged this alliance through marriage, by becoming either the father in law or brother in law of the Ashqilula chieftain.

The oldest son of Henry I the Fowler and Matilda, Otto was "the first of the Germans to be called the emperor of Italy".[PARAGRAPH:2]Otto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father's death in 936. He continued his father's work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king's powers at the expense of the aristocracy. Through strategic marriages and personal appointments, Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom's most important duchies. This reduced the various dukes, who had previously been co-equals with the king, to royal subjects under his authority. Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen the royal office and subjected its clergy to his personal control.[PARAGRAPH:2]After putting down a brief civil war among the rebellious duchies, Otto defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, thus ending the Hungarian invasions of Western Europe. The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto a reputation as a savior of Christendom and secured his hold over the kingdom. By 961, Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy and extended his realm's borders to the north, east, and south. The patronage of Otto and his immediate successors facilitated a limited cultural renaissance of the arts and architecture. Following the example of Charlemagne's coronation as "Emperor of the Romans" in 800, Otto was crowned Emperor in 962 by Pope John XII in Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]Otto's later years were marked by conflicts with the Papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy. Reigning from Rome, Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire, which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm's further expansion to the south. To resolve this conflict, the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son, Otto II, in April 972. Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in 973.

His mother gave him what would later be the Free County of Burgundy around Dole in 982. Otto also inherited the duchy of Burgundy on the other side of the Sane in 1002 from his stepfather Eudes Henry the Great. The duchy then corresponded to the diocese of Besanon in the Holy Roman Empire. By 990 Otto-William was the Count of Nevers. He was also Count of Mon in France. While the son of a king, he did not himself seek a royal wife. In c.?975-80 he married Ermentrude of Roucy whose maternal grandmother, Gerberga of Saxony was a sister of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor and by this marriage alliance it caused a web of consanguinity between later kings of France, Germany, Burgundy and the Carolingians. Even his children's spouses, although from great families, came from widespread and scattered parts of France.[PARAGRAPH:2]Burgundy was annexed to the crown of France by King Robert II in 1004. Determined to be sovereign ruler of his own lands, Otto revolted against the Emperor Henry II in 1016. This was after Rudolph III of Burgundy, the last king of that realm, had done homage to Henry at Strasbourg making him his guard and heir. On Otto's death, the Free County fell under the suzerainty of the German emperors. Otto-William died 21 September, 1026 at the age of 64.</English>

The expedition was a private undertaking. He and Primo initially marched south towards Ascalon, but an Egyptian army forced them to march inland towards the Siege of Jerusalem, then in progress. The lumber from their dismantled ships was converted into siege towers which were instrumental in the successful taking of the city on 15 July. It was there that Embriaco earned his sobriquet Caputmallei or Testadimaglio, meaning "mallet head".[PARAGRAPH:2]Embriaco assisted in the capture of Jaffa and then, with 200 to 300 men, at the Battle of Ascalon on 12 August, where he commanded a naval contingent offshore. Embriaco and his brother returned to Genoa with letters from Godfrey of Bouillon and Daimbert of Pisa, the Defender of the Holy Sepulchre and Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem respectively, describing the success of the Crusaders and the urgent need of reinforcements. They arrived in Genoa on 24 December. Embriaco was granted the title of consul exercitus Ianuensium - "consul of the Genoese army" - by the Compagna and sent back with a fleet of twenty six or seven galleys, four to six cargo ships, and three to four thousand men. He embarked, carrying the new papal legate, the cardinal-bishop of Ostia, on 1 August 1100.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his second arrival in the Holy Land, he met King Baldwin I at Laodicea and together they planned a campaign against for the next spring. At Laodicea, he wintered and fought many skirmishes with the Saracen corsairs. In March 1101, he set out from Laodicea, evading a large Egyptian fleet near Haifa, and landed at Jaffa on Easter Monday. He accompanied Baldwin from there to Jerusalem to celebrate Easter and visit the River Jordan. The Genoese were promised a third of the booty of the campaign and they set out for Arsuf, which fell after three days on 9 May. Caesarea held out until 17 May. A thousand Arab merchants who had taken refuge in the mosque paid the Genoese for their release and safety.[PARAGRAPH:2]In July, Embriaco returned to Genoa after making a treaty with Tancred, Prince of Galilee. He met a Byzantine fleet in the Ionian Islands and landed at Corfu to send ambassadors to Constantinople. He entered Genoa in triumph in October.[PARAGRAPH:2]In February 1102 he was elected Consul, but that is the last recorded trace of him.</English>

    <English>[H1]Robert the Bruce[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Scots[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] July 11, 1274 - June 7, 1329[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Robert I (11 July 1274 - 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (Medieval Gaelic: Roibert a Briuis; modern Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart Bruis; Norman French: Robert de Brus or Robert de Bruys, Early Scots: Robert Brus), was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329. Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led Scotland during the Wars of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent nation and is today remembered in Scotland as a national hero.[PARAGRAPH:2]Descended from the Anglo-Norman and Gaelic nobilities, his paternal fourth-great grandfather was David I. Robert's grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the "Great Cause". As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the throne and took part in William Wallace's revolt against Edward I of England. In 1298, Bruce became a Guardian of Scotland alongside his great rival for the Scottish throne, John Comyn, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. Bruce resigned as guardian in 1300 due in part to his quarrels with Comyn but chiefly because the restoration of King John seemed imminent. In 1302, he submitted to Edward I and returned to "the king's peace". When his father died in 1304, Bruce inherited his family's claim to the throne. In February 1306, following an argument during a meeting at Greyfriars monastery, Dumfries, Bruce killed Comyn. He was excommunicated by the Pope but absolved by Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306, at Scone. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in battle, and Bruce was forced to flee into hiding in the Hebrides and Ireland before returning in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Bruce defeated the Comyns and his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands from Buchan to Galloway. In 1309, he held his first parliament at St Andrews, and a series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland. At the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314, Bruce defeated a much larger English army under Edward II, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish monarchy. The battle marked a significant turning point, and, freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England; Bruce launched devastating raids into Lancashire and Yorkshire. He also decided to expand his war against the English and create a second front by sending an army under his younger brother, Edward, to invade Ireland, appealing to the native Irish to rise against Edward II's rule.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to give up his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish magnates and nobles submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Bruce as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Bruce as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was temporarily concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Robert I died on 7 June 1329. His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey. Bruce's lieutenant and friend Sir James Douglas agreed to take the late King's embalmed heart on crusade to the Lord's Sepulchre in the Holy Land, but he only reached Moorish Granada. Douglas was killed in battle during the siege of Teba while fulfilling his promise. His body and the casket containing the embalmed heart were found upon the field. They were both conveyed back to Scotland by Sir William Keith of Galston.</English>

According to legend and historical tradition, Marfa led the republic's struggle against Muscovy between her husband's death and the city's eventual annexation by Ivan III of Russia in 1478.[PARAGRAPH:2]While she is referred to as Mayoress, this was in no way a formal office. She may have been the focal point of the anti-Muscovite faction and had considerable charisma or influence as the matriarch of the clan, but never held actual office in Novgorod as they were confined to the male land-owners.[PARAGRAPH:2]Marfa was widowed in the 1460s but remained one of the wealthiest individuals in Novgorod who owned sizable estates. Peasants on her lands to the north of Novgorod engaged in fishing, fur hunting, livestock raising, and salt boiling. Her southern estates produced edible grains and flax.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the middle of the fifteenth century, the relations between the principalities of Moscow and Novgorod, long strained by chronic disputes over trade, taxes, and legal jurisdiction, intensified into overt hostilities. In 1471 Marfa and her sons, Dmitrii and Fedor (as the last representatives of the anti-Muscovite Boretsky family), and a party of loyal Novgorodian boyars, attempted to negotiate with Casimir IV Jagiellon the terms of the city's handover to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, provided that the city's ancient privileges and rights will be retained.[PARAGRAPH:2]On hearing about Marfa's manoeuvres, Ivan III advanced against Novgorod and defeated the Novgorodian volunteer army in the decisive Battle of Shelon (July 14, 1471). Marfa's son Dmitrii, who served as mayor during 1470 and 1471, was executed on July 24, 1471 at the behest of the grand prince. Her other son Fedor has also been identified with the pro-Lithuanian faction in Novgorod. The evidence for his activity is ambiguous, nevertheless he was arrested in 1476 and exiled to Murom, where he died that same year.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although she continued to rely on Lithuania's support and intrigue against Moscow, Ivan III finally subjugated Novgorod in 1478. He ordered that Muscovite governors be introduced into Novgorod and that the landowning elite be evicted and resettled. Marfa and her grandsons were taken into custody and escorted to Moscow (February 7, 1478), all her lands were confiscated. According to tradition, Marfa was forced to take the veil in Nizhny Novgorod, the date and circumstances of her death are uncertain.</English>

His long reign saw the expansion of the House of Arag on all sides: into Valencia to the south, Languedoc to the north, and the Balearic Islands to the east. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the Spanish kings. James compiled the Llibre del Consulat de Mar, which governed maritime trade and helped establish Catalan supremacy in the western Mediterranean.

He is generally regarded as the most successful of the Stewart monarchs of Scotland, but his reign ended with the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Flodden Field, where he became the last monarch from not only Scotland, but also from all of Great Britain, to be killed in battle.[PARAGRAPH:2]In May 1493 John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, was forfeited by the Parliament of Scotland. King James himself sailed to Dunstaffnage Castle, where the western chiefs made their submission to him. John surrendered and was brought back as a pensioner to the royal court, then lived at Paisley Abbey. The Highlands and Islands now fell to direct royal control. John's grandson Domhnall Dubh (Donald Owre), one of the possible claimants to the Lordship was peaceable, but the other, his nephew Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh invaded Ross and was later killed on the island of Oronsay in 1497.[PARAGRAPH:2]In October 1496 the Royal Council ordered that the Clan Chiefs in the region would be held responsible by the king for crimes of the islanders. This act for the governance of the region was unworkable, and after the Act of Revocation of 1498 undermined the Chief's titles to their lands, resistance to Edinburgh rule was strengthened. James waited at Kilkerran Castle at Campbeltown Loch to re-grant the Chief's charters in the summer of 1498. Few of the Chiefs turned up. At first, Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll, was set to fill the power vacuum and enforce royal authority, but he met with limited success in a struggle with his brother-in-law, Torquil MacLeod of Lewis. Torquil was ordered to hand over Donald Dubh, heir to the lordship of the Isles, to James IV at Inverness in 1501. James waited, but Torquil never came.[PARAGRAPH:2]After this defiance, Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly, was granted Torquil's lands. He raised an army in Lochaber and also cleared the tenants of that area, replacing them with his supporters. After the parliament of 1504, a royal fleet sailed north from Ayr to attack the Castle of Cairn-na-Burgh, west of Mull, where, it is thought, Maclean of Duart had Donald Dubh in his keeping. As progress at the siege was slow, James sent Hans the royal gunner in Robert Barton's ship and then the Earl of Arran with provisions and more artillery. Cairn-na-Burgh was captured by June 1504 but Donald Dubh remained at liberty. In September 1507, Torquil MacLeod was besieged at Stornoway Castle on Lewis. Donald Dubh was captured and kept in prison for the rest of life, and Torquil MacLeod died in exile in 1511. The Earl of Huntly was richly rewarded for his troubles, a price that James was prepared to pay.</English>

He was the son of Ferdinand I and his wife Eleanor of Alburquerque. John is regarded as one of the most memorable kings of the 15th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]John was born at Medina del Campo. In his youth he was one of the infantes (princes) of Aragon who took part in the dissensions of Castile during the minority and reign of John II. Till middle life he was also lieutenant-general in Aragon for his brother and predecessor Alfonso V, whose reign was mainly spent in Italy. In his old age he was engaged in incessant conflicts with his Aragonese and Catalan subjects, with Louis XI of France, and in preparing the way for the marriage of his son Ferdinand with Isabella I of Castile which brought about the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile and which was to create the Kingdom of Spain. His troubles with his subjects were closely connected with tragic dissensions within his own family.[PARAGRAPH:2]John was first married to Blanche I of Navarre of the house of vreux. By right of Blanche he became king of Navarre, and on her death in 1441 he was left in possession of the kingdom for his lifetime. But one son, Charles, given the title "Prince of Viana" as heir of Navarre, had been born of the marriage. John quickly came to regard this son with jealousy. After his second marriage, to Juana Enrquez, it grew into absolute hatred, being encouraged by Juana. John tried to deprive his son of his constitutional right to act as lieutenant-general of Aragon during his father's absence. Charles's cause was taken up by the Aragonese, however, and the king's attempt to make his second wife lieutenant-general was set aside.[PARAGRAPH:2]There followed the long Navarrese Civil War, with alternations of success and defeat, ending only with the death of the prince of Viana, perhaps by poison administered by his stepmother in 1461. The Catalans, who had adopted the cause of Charles and who had grievances of their own, called in a succession of foreign pretenders in a War against John II. His last years John spent contending with these. He was forced to pawn Roussillon, his possession on the north-east of the Pyrenees, to King Louis XI of France, who refused to part with it.[PARAGRAPH:2]In his old age John was blinded by cataracts, but recovered his eyesight by the operation of couching conducted by his physician Abiathar Crescas, a Jew. The Catalan revolt was pacified in 1472, but John carried on a war, in which he was generally unfortunate, with his neighbor the French king till his death in 1479. He was succeeded by Ferdinand, his son by his second marriage, who was already married to Isabella I of Castile. With his death and son's accession to the throne of Aragon, the unification of Spain under one royal house began in earnest.</English>
