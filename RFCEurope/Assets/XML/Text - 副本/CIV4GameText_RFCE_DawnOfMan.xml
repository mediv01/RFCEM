     <Chinese>For the last few hundred years, Sweden has in some ways been the least developed of the Scandinavian nations. Though several rulers at Uppsala have claimed kingship over Sweden, few have had any power outside Uppland. Christianisation has been slow as well. Southern Sweden was even the target of a crusade less than a century ago, yet pagan beliefs are still important in much of the country.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is now the year 1210 AD, and this year things are to change. Eric the Survivor has managed to destroy his rivals in a bloody civil war and become the first ever Swedish King to be crowned by the Church. The separatists are rapidly losing power and the people of Uppland are about to lose their ancient privileges. The stage is set for the consolidation of Sweden.</Chinese>
