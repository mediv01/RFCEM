    <English>[TAB]The Knights Hospitaller (also known as the Sovereign Military Hospitaller, Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodos and of Malta, Knights of Malta, Knights of Rhodos and Chevaliers of Malta) is a Christian organization that began as an Amalfitan hospital founded in Jerusalem in 1080 to provide care for poor and sick pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the Christian conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade, it became a religious/military order under its own charter, and was charged with the care and defense of the Holy Land. Following the loss of the Holy Land by Christan forces, the Order operated from Rhodos, over which it was sovereign, and later from Malta where it administered a vassal state under the Spanish viceroy of Sicily.</English>

However, although formally an institution of the Hospitallers, the Pope commanded that the prior and the brothers of the domus Teutonicorum (house of the Germans) should always be Germans themselves, so a tradition of a German-led religious institution could develop during the 12th century in Palestine.</English>

The Bank did not only have economic power, but was involved at the politics of Genoa as well, due to the merchants' role in running the Republic of Genoa. In fact, the Bank controlled many of the Genoans' overseas territories, including Corsica. It gained reputation in 15th an 16th centuries, when prominent European Leaders (including Isabella of Spain) had accounts there. Later, it antagonized the Dutch and English East India Companies in maritime trading. It was closed by Napoleon in 1805.</English>

It was fashioned after the military orders of the Crusades, requiring its initiates to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christianity, in particular the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]On the other hand it was in great extent based on the Order of St George (Hungarian: Szent Gyrgy Vitzei Lovagrend), which was the first secular chivalric order in the world and was established in 1326 by King Charles I of Hungary (Kroly I, reigned 1308-1342), flourished during Charles' reign and achieved greater success under the reign of his son Louis I of Hungary (Nagy Lajos, reigned 1342-1382), but was mostly destroyed in the civil war and unstable political situation after the death of Louis.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Order of the Dragon is also secular, the original members were mostly Sigismund's political allies and supporters. Most of these members were referred to in the statutes as barons (barones, occasionally socii). As membership grew, the Order of the Dragon came to have two degrees. There was a superior class, which between 1408 and 1418 wore both the dragon and the cross as the Order's emblem and a more elaborate version afterwards. The second degree had a large number of members, and its symbol was only the dragon.[PARAGRAPH:2]The insignia was described in length in contemporary sources, including the edict of the Order itself in 1408: "the sign or effigy of the Dragon incurved into the form of a circle, its tail winding around its neck, divided through the middle of its back along its length from the top of its head right to the tip of its tail, with blood [forming] a red cross flowing out into the interior of the cleft by a white crack, untouched by blood, just as and in the same way that those who fight under the banner of the glorious martyr St George are accustomed to bear a red cross on a white field."[PARAGRAPH:2]The Order flourished during the first half of the 15th century, primarily in Hungary, Germany and Italy. After Sigismund's death in 1437, its importance declined in Western Europe, but after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, it continued to play a role in Hungary, Serbia, Croatia and Wallachia which bore the brunt of the Ottoman incursions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Fun fact: the name Dracula origins from the Order of the Dragon![NEWLINE]Vlad III (also known as Vlad the Impaler) was a ruthless Voivode (prince) of Wallachia in the second half of the 15th century. Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as Dracula, Dracuglia, or Drakula; he himself signed some of his letters as "Dragulya" or "Drakulya" in the late 1470s. This name had its origin in the Romanian sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul ("Vlad the Dragon"), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon! During the following centuries his bloody deeds and the Dracula name merged together, and the modern vampire figure Dracula was born.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The Order of Calatrava (Spanish: Orden de Calatrava Portuguese: Ordem de Calatrava) was the first military order founded in Castile. The papal bull confirming the Order of Calatrava as a Militia was given by Pope Alexander III on September 26, 1164.[PARAGRAPH:2]The etymology of the name of this military order, Calatrava, conveys the meaning: "fortress of Rabah". In the monastic Cistercian Order (formed only a couple years earlier), there had been a large number of knights or sons of knights. In Calatrava, on the contrary, those who had been monks became knights. Monastic life has been called "a warfare", and it would be a mistake to suppose those rough medieval warriors sought in the cloister only a comfortable asylum after a troubled career. In both lives there was an heroic struggle to sustain, whether against one's passions or against the Muslims, and the austerities of an ascetic life could not have been more dreadful to them than the privations of camp life and the wounds of battle.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Order of Calatrava was a very significant force in the battles with the Muslims in the early times of the Reconquista: Even the first military services of the Knights of Calatrava were highly successful, and in return for the exceptional services they had rendered they received from the King of Castile new grants of land, which formed their first commanderies. They had also been called into the neighbouring Kingdom of Aragon, and been rewarded by new encomiendas (landed estates). But these successes were followed by a series of misfortunes, due in the first instance to the unfortunate partition which Alfonso had made of his possessions, and the consequent rivalry which ensued between the Castilian and Leonese branches of his dynasty. At the same time the first successes of the Reconquista in the 12th century soon met up with a new wave of Islamic warriors, the invasion of the Almohads from Morocco.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nevertheless the Order of Calatrava remained one of the most powerful Military Orders during the Reconquista, taking part in many campaigns against the Cordobans and Moors of the Iberian peninsula. Most of the political and military power of the order dissipated by the end of the 15th century, but the last dissolution of the order's property did not occur until 1838.</English>
