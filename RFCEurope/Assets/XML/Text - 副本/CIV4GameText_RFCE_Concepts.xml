    <English>[H1]Historical Starts[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]This is why your game won't start immediately for most Civs. Rhye's mod, above all else, was designed to mirror history. As such, most civs spawn many years into the game, as late as 1581 for the Dutch. If you want to play as a late spawning civ now, you can use the 1200AD scenario. Don't worry about being behind; you will start with many units and techs to place you on an even footing with the AIs.[PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to all those units and techs, you may even have some cities flip for you. Although, be aware when playing imperialistic civilizations such as Byzantium, Germany and France. New civs will carve their empires out of your land! If you refuse to let go of the cities, units in the area will join the resistance for several turns. If you decide to resist the wave of nationalism, make sure your army is large enough to handle defectors!</English>

The general idea behind Stability is that your empire can expand only so far in the world before cries for independence lead to whole nations rising again from the dust, or a collapse into Civil War. As frustrating as it is exciting, this section will help you better understand Stability and prevent you from collapsing "for no apparent reason".[PARAGRAPH:2]On the Interior Advisor (F2) screen, there are 5 new boxes added. These star ratings represent how well you are doing in several areas of stability. 3 is average, and all civs start with 3 stars in every box. An average of 3 stars produces a "stable" rating. This means you're not falling apart, but may from some unstable decisions. Unstable means that new civs may rise and declare their independence from you. Collapsing means that you can no longer stave off the masses. A few turns of Collapsing will send your empire into civil war, leaving you with only your capital under control. Solid and Very Solid are good times to be expanding your empire. You can keep an eye on your and other civ's stability ratings with the new icons on the mini-score screen. The red ball on top of a hill stands for Unstable or Collapsing, on flat ground represents Stable or Shaky and inside a dip means Solid or Very Solid.[PARAGRAPH:2]The five groupings for the star rating are a rough reflection of how you are performing in various aspects. Cities reflects how well developed your cities are. Civics reflects how many turns of anarchy you've had (bad) and how much synergy is present in your civics. Economy is based mostly off of your GNP, which factors in your commerce, production, food and a couple other values. Expansion reflects how far out of your "natural" home (check a historical atlas) you've gone and how well you've used your chosen Expansion civic. Foreign represents general foreign sentiment and your solid diplomatic relationships.[PARAGRAPH:2]In fact, nearly everything affects your stability. Common sense will help you determine what increases your stability and what leads to civil war.</English>

In RFC:Europe colonies are represented by colonial projects.[PARAGRAPH:2]There are two Trading Companies that are national projects (i.e. everyone can have one of those) and a number of colonies that are world projects (i.e. only one player can build them). Some colonial projects require one Trading Company or another in order to be build. Every colony requires a specific tech and all the colonies require the abstract resource "Atlantic Access".[PARAGRAPH:2]We have added the Atlantic Access to ensure that colonies are mainly build by the historical colonial powers (note that this is different from physical access to the Atlantic Ocean). The number of AA resources is kept to a minimum to represent interesting gameplay. Traditional colonial powers, such as Portugal, Spain, England, France and the Netherlands, receive AA by default. Mediterranean nations can obtain AA from by establishing control over the Gibraltar straight and others can do that by war or trade with the colonial powers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Colonies are furthermore divided into several regions (South America, North America, Asia and Africa). Excluding the colonies in Africa, establishing a colony in a given region will grant the player an additional access resource that will make further colonies in that region easier to create (i.e. having Virginia would make it easier to colonize New England).[PARAGRAPH:2]Every colony provides a number of resources for the nation that builds it. Many of those resources cannot be obtained by any other way (i.e. they are not present on the map). Colonies add to the overall score of the player.

    <Tag>TXT_KEY_CONCEPT_RELIGION_OVERHAUL_PEDIA</Tag>
    <English>[H1]Religion Overhaul[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]What sets RFC:Europe apart from RFC is the complete overhaul of the religion dynamics. We have four major religions (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism and Islam) as well as Judaism as a minor religion. All religions are asymmetric, with each one providing unique befits. In order to simulate the complicated dynamics that existed between the religions, we have implemented The Great Schism, Reformation, Crusades, The Pope as a special player, Faith Points and Religious Prosecutions.[NEWLINE]
[H2]On the Five Religions[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Catholicism, Judaism and Orthodoxy are founded at the start of the game, with Holy Cities at Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople. Islam is founded on the turn that Arabia spawns, with Holy City at Damascus. Mecca is geographically not included and hence Damascus was chosen as the Arabic center of religious power (as well as the Arabic capital). Protestantism is founded by the first player to research the Printing Press, the Protestant Holy City is chosen at random, much like Holy Cities in regular BtS. Whenever a religion is founded, the Holy Shrine is automatically build in the corresponding Holy City.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Judaism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike the other four religions, Jews never tried to spread their faith by the sword and quite often they were the victims of that sword. In RFC:Europe Jews spread throughout Europe in a semi-random manner, driven by trade and trade opportunities. Cities with Judaism can build Jewish Quarters that provide a boost of culture and gold.[NEWLINE]
[H2]The Great Schism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Prior to 1054AD, Catholics and Orthodoxes had many differences, but in more ways then not acted as a single religion. In RFC:Europe, there is no diplomatic penalty between Catholic and Orthodox players, until 1054AD.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Reformation[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The discovery of the Printing Press and founding Protestantism trigger the Reformation. All Catholic players have the opportunity to convert to the new religion. Conversion changes Catholicism to Protestantism and all the religious buildings are converted to their corresponding counterparts, however, Catholicism is not completely removed from all the large cities. Some of the Faith Points are also generated. The AI's probability to convert is based upon the actual history of the corresponding nation.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Faith Points[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Faith points are an abstract concept that determines the level of benefits that a player can obtain from the corresponding religion.[NEWLINE]
- Civilizations generally start with 0 faith points.
- Changing the state religion resets the faith points to 0.
- Spread of the state religion throughout the empire and building religious buildings (Temples, Monasteries and Cathedrals) generate faith points.
- Spread of a non-state religion decreases the amount of faith points.
- Faith points provide different benefit for every religion
- Large boost of Faith Points is provided by the Great Prophets to compensate for the fact that they can no longer build Holy Shrines
- The current number of Faith Points and the benefits thay provide can be seen in the Religious Advisor screen[NEWLINE]
[H2]Catholicism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The benefits of Faith Points for Catholic players are not as straight forward as those for the other religions. It all revolves around the Pope and his role as an absolute authority over the Catholic Church. Check the special section on the Pope and his role in the game.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Islam[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Geographically Islam stretches well beyond the boundaries of our map. Thus, with strong faith (i.e. a lot of Faith Points), the Islamic nations receive a boost on their Growth as well as a hammer discount for new Units.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Orthodoxy[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]One of the key concepts of the Orthodox Church is the principle of Caesaropapism, that is the subjugation of the religious authority under the secular authority. As a result, strong faith boosts the stability of the Orthodox nations and lowers the civic maintenance cost.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Protestantism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The new liberal ideas and emphasis on personal freedom, grant the Protestant nations beaker discount for new techs and hammer discount on the production of Colonies and Wonders.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Religious Prosecutions and Stability[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]As ugly as they were, religious prosecutions were very common in medieval Europe. Thus, in RFC:Europe we present the Prosecutor unit that can be used to remove all non-state religions and buildings from a given city.[NEWLINE]
- Non-state religion in your cities causes instability
- Prosecutions remove the non-state religion and buildings, but generate unhappiness and cause instability of their own, resulting in an even larger penalty
- Prosecution instability and unhappiness wear off over time, so the short term penalty creates a long term benefit
- Spain does not suffer from Prosecution penalty, however, they do suffer from unhappiness
- Prosecutions generate Faith Points
- The combined Prosecution instability vs added Faith Points and boost of Orthodox stability still generates short term instability
- Religion cannot be removed from its Holy City (i.e. no religion can be completely destroyed) and no religion can be removed from Jerusalem
- When Jews are being prosecuted from one city, they automatically move to another from the same or different nation
- Under the civic Free Religion, Prosecutions are impossible and no instability is generated by numerous religions in the same city[NEWLINE]
[H2]The Pope[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church and has absolute authority over it. Every player that choses Catholicism would have to interact with the Pope in more than one way.[NEWLINE]
- The Pope can never control any city other than Rome and the Pope's culture cannot extend beyond Rome's BFC
- The Pope would gift money and units to faithful Catholic players
- Relations with the Pope play a major role in the Crusade dynamics
- To get any benefits from the Pope you must Open Borders with him
- If you Open Borders with the Pope, you will soon see an army of Missionaries spreading Catholicism for you
- On the same note, for a non-Catholic player, Open Borders with the Pope is probably not a good idea (see Prosecutions and Stability)
- The Pope would also randomly build Churches and Monasteries for the Catholic nations
- The Pope can remove non-Catholic religions from the cities of Catholic players (generating unhappiness and instability for the corresponding player)[NEWLINE]
[H2]The Choice of Religion[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The benefits from choosing one religion over another are tied to the individual civilizations' historical preferences. For example the Byzantines would definitely benefit more from Orthodoxy and Spain from Catholicism. Going with the historical setting is never a wrong decision, however, you are always free to experiment anyway you want.</English>

    <Chinese>[H1]Religion Overhaul[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]What sets RFC:Europe apart from RFC is the complete overhaul of the religion dynamics. We have four major religions (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism and Islam) as well as Judaism as a minor religion. All religions are asymmetric, with each one providing unique befits. In order to simulate the complicated dynamics that existed between the religions, we have implemented The Great Schism, Reformation, Crusades, The Pope as a special player, Faith Points and Religious Prosecutions.[NEWLINE]
[H2]On the Five Religions[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Catholicism, Judaism and Orthodoxy are founded at the start of the game, with Holy Cities at Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople. Islam is founded on the turn that Arabia spawns, with Holy City at Damascus. Mecca is geographically not included and hence Damascus was chosen as the Arabic center of religious power (as well as the Arabic capital). Protestantism is founded by the first player to research the Printing Press, the Protestant Holy City is chosen at random, much like Holy Cities in regular BtS. Whenever a religion is founded, the Holy Shrine is automatically build in the corresponding Holy City.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Judaism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike the other four religions, Jews never tried to spread their faith by the sword and quite often they were the victims of that sword. In RFC:Europe Jews spread throughout Europe in a semi-random manner, driven by trade and trade opportunities. Cities with Judaism can build Jewish Quarters that provide a boost of culture and gold.[NEWLINE]
[H2]The Great Schism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Prior to 1054AD, Catholics and Orthodoxes had many differences, but in more ways then not acted as a single religion. In RFC:Europe, there is no diplomatic penalty between Catholic and Orthodox players, until 1054AD.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Reformation[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The discovery of the Printing Press and founding Protestantism trigger the Reformation. All Catholic players have the opportunity to convert to the new religion. Conversion changes Catholicism to Protestantism and all the religious buildings are converted to their corresponding counterparts, however, Catholicism is not completely removed from all the large cities. Some of the Faith Points are also generated. The AI's probability to convert is based upon the actual history of the corresponding nation.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Faith Points[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Faith points are an abstract concept that determines the level of benefits that a player can obtain from the corresponding religion.[NEWLINE]
- Civilizations generally start with 0 faith points.
- Changing the state religion resets the faith points to 0.
- Spread of the state religion throughout the empire and building religious buildings (Temples, Monasteries and Cathedrals) generate faith points.
- Spread of a non-state religion decreases the amount of faith points.
- Faith points provide different benefit for every religion
- Large boost of Faith Points is provided by the Great Prophets to compensate for the fact that they can no longer build Holy Shrines
- The current number of Faith Points and the benefits thay provide can be seen in the Religious Advisor screen[NEWLINE]
[H2]Catholicism[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The benefits of Faith Points for Catholic players are not as straight forward as those for the other religions. It all revolves around the Pope and his role as an absolute authority over the Catholic Church. Check the special section on the Pope and his role in the game.[NEWLINE]

    <English>[H1]Crusades[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]There are two types of Crusades: for the Holy Land that aim at capturing Jerusalem and Defensive that aim at reclaiming a city lost by a Catholic player.[NEWLINE]
[H2]Crusades for the Holy Land[\H2]
- From the 1000AD on, the Pope may periodically call for a Crusade for the Holy Land
- A Crusade is called only if Jerusalem is controlled by a non-Catholic, non-Orthodox player
- Every Catholic nation can participate in the Crusade, sending some units at random (city defenders do not get send off, but other units leave)
- Teutonic Knights and Knight Templars are very likely to leave for the Crusade, Knights are also generally more likely to leave then Archers
- All participants get to vote on a Crusade leader, where the candidates are chosen for their high Faith Points, size of the Empire and good relations with the Pope
- The chosen leader of the Crusade declares war on whomever controls Jerusalem and a few turns later receives a stack of units next to the city
- The first Catholic player that captures Jerusalem (with or without a Crusade) receives a golden age as well as boost of stability and faith
- Refusal to participate in the Crusade decreases one's faith and relations with the Pope
- Sometimes, Crusades can be deviated to go not after Jerusalem, but the capital of any non-Catholic nation
- The richest Catholic player gets the opportunity to deviate the crusade for certain amount of gold
- If one uses gold to take over the Crusade, one can still aim it at Jerusalem
- Reformation makes the Catholic church turn to its own internal affairs and thus stops any further Crusades for the Holy Land[NEWLINE]
[H2]Defensive Crusades[\H2]
- If there is a non-Catholic and non-Orthodox player holding a city in a Catholic player's war map zone then a defensive Crusade can be called
- If the Catholic player is at war with the one holding the city, and if the Catholic player has good relations with the Pope, the Catholic player may get an opportunity for a Defensive Crusade
- Defensive Crusade means that some units would spawn at the Catholic player's capital
- Defensive Crusades cost faith points
- Faith points can be regained by conquering the other player's cities and converting them to Catholicism[NEWLINE]
[H2]Crusades and non-Catholic Religions[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]If you are an Islamic player, prepare for the Crusaders. Whether you are fighting against the Reconquista, defending Jerusalem or conquering Hungary, Crusaders will come to visit you. Meet them accordingly. Strong Islamic faith would help you build more units and successfully fight off the Crusaders.
[PARAGRAPH:1]Judaism is not meant to be anyone's state religion, however, it as vulnerable to Crusades as Islam.
[PARAGRAPH:1]Orthodox players are generally immune to Crusades, but beware of Balduin I, VI and IX (all numbers refer to the same person). Crusaders can always get greedy and attack you for purely economical reasons.
[PARAGRAPH:1]Reformation stops the Crusades for the Holy Land, however, if you are at war with a Catholic nation, you may still suffer from a defensive Crusade.[NEWLINE]</English>

    <Chinese>[H1]十字军[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]这里有两种形式的十字军: 攻占圣城Jerusalem和防御战(Defensive Crusades)帮助天主教国家重夺一座他丢失的一座城市.[NEWLINE]
[H2]为圣城发起的十字军[\H2]
- AD1000开始,教皇会周期性的发起十字军收复圣城
- 十字军只会当Jerusalem被控制于一个非天主教和东正教国家手里时发起
- 每一个天主教国家都可以参与十字军并且随机赠送一些部队出去(城市保卫者city defenders 不会被送出去,但其他单位会离开)
- 条顿骑士和圣殿骑士非常可能会离开,骑士一般比弓箭单位更可能被送出去
- 所有参与者都投票选出十字军的领导者,候选人一般依据他们的高信仰点，帝国大小以及和教皇的关系是否更好
- 选出来的领导者会对控制圣城的文明宣战,然后在一定回合以后送来的单位会直接传送到圣城旁边
- 第一个攻占圣城的天主教玩家(是十字军或不是都可以)都会开启一次黄金时代同时获得稳定度以及信仰点奖励
- 拒绝参与十字军行动会降低你的信仰点以及恶化你与教皇的关系
- 有时候十字军很有可能产生偏离不去圣城,而是去到任意一个非天主教文明的首都附近
- 最富有的天主教玩家有机会通过金钱偏离十字军的目标
- 如果你用金钱控制了十字军后,你依然可以将目标设定为圣城耶路撒冷 
- 宗教改革使得天主教会变成它自己内部的事情，也因此停止了后续的对圣城的十字军行动Reformation makes the Catholic church turn to its own internal affairs and thus stops any further Crusades for the Holy Land[NEWLINE]
[H2]十字军防御战[\H2]
- 如果这里有一个非天主教和非东正教的文明占领了一座在天主教玩家战争地图上显示(in a Catholic player's war map zone)的城市,那么将触发十字军防御战
- 如果天主教玩家与操控该城市的国家已经处于战争状态同时该天主教文明和教皇关系良好,那么天主教玩家也有机会开展十字军防御战If the Catholic player is at war with the one holding the city, and if the Catholic player has good relations with the Pope, the Catholic player may get an opportunity for a Defensive Crusade
- 十字军防御战意味着一些单位将会出现首都附近
- 十字军防御战消耗信仰点
- 信阳点数可以通过攻占其他玩家的城市而重新获得或者使他们皈依天主教[NEWLINE]
[H2]非天主教文明和十字军[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]如果你是伊斯兰文明, 请为十字军入侵做准备.无论你是在对抗收复失地运动(卡斯提尔收复伊比利亚半岛),保卫Jerusalem或者正在征服匈牙利,十字军都有可能相应出现. 强大的伊斯兰信仰(信仰点?)将会帮你暴更多兵来打败十字军.
[PARAGRAPH:1]犹太教不会成为任何一个国家的国教 is not meant to be anyone's state religion,但是它也可能会像伊斯兰教很容易成为十字军的目标.
[PARAGRAPH:1]东正教文明一般免疫十字军,但是请小心Balduin I, VI and IX (所有这些数字都指代同一个人).十字军总是很贪婪的因此他们很有可能仅仅回了财富而攻击你.
[PARAGRAPH:1]改革会停止对圣城的十字军行动.但是如果你一个天主教文明开战时,你依然有可能出发十字军防御战.[NEWLINE]</Chinese>

    <English>[H1]RFCE stability guide:[\H1]

[BOLD]The F2 Screen[\BOLD]
On the F2-screen you can see the four main stability categories: cities, civics, economy, expansion and a special fifth category called swing. 
The main categories have two values: the one on the left side is the sum of all permanent modifiers and the one on the right side is a value that is calculated every turn.
The swing category has only one value and represents effects that last only a few turns. Most of the time this value should be zero.

All values are summed up and give the total stability or simply the stability (The value that can be seen on the main screen). This is the only value that matters in the end.

[BOLD]The two ways how stability is calculated[\BOLD]
There are two ways in which stability is calculated: event based and state based.
You can say the state based modifiers look at what you have (eg. total number of cities) and the event based look on how you got there (eg. if you found a city yourself or if you conquer one).

[BOLD]State based modifiers[\BOLD]
The state based modifiers have to be updated once in a while. This is usually done every turn or every three turns or when it is obvious that the state has changed (eg. founding a city will change the total number of cities and therefore triggers a recalculation). Because they only look at the current state they can be recalculated from scratch every time. Previous values don't have to be remembered. That means if an error occures, this error can not accumulate over several calculations and the total effect of one modifier can easily be limited.
The effects of state-based modifiers are hard to track because all effects are calculated at once.

[BOLD]Event based modifiers[\BOLD]
The event based modifiers on the other hand can not be calculated from the scratch every time and therefore have to be remembered. This is done by storing a single number for each category. It holds the sum of all modifiers that have been triggered so far. That means those modifiers are permanent and cumulative. And that means also that errors can accumulate. And because only a single number is stored it is impossible to say how often a certain event has occured and therefore it is impossible to limit the total effect of a single modifier.
The effect of event-based modifiers can easily be seen. Just found, conquer or raze a city and look on the F2-screen how the corresponding value has changed. Sometimes more then one event is triggered at once (eg. razing a city triggers also conquering a city)

[BOLD]Useful tips[\BOLD]
The swing category has only event based modifiers, sometimes with rather big values.
On the other hand it's value gets halved every turn, so it rapidly converges to zero.

Note that one of the big permanent changes in stability happens when some of your provinces change to worse status.
In most cases this happens when a new civ is born in or near your territory (the first example is the Arab spawn for Byzantium).

Various special events and historic mechanisms can also effect your stability.
For example on the reformation event: If you choose to stay catholic, you miss on the economic and scientific benefits of switching to protestantism, but the counter-reformation might bring some stability to your realm.
Or you get a minor bonus to your stability in case you successfully complete one of your UHVs.

[BOLD]The F2 Screen[\BOLD]
译者前言：这是个人渣翻，所以出现翻译奇怪的地方请多包涵，我不确定的地方会在后面保留原文             贴吧 by tyrm8 译于RFCE1.5版本
在F2界面你可以看见四个主要的稳定度分类: 城市, 内政法令, 经济因素, 扩张 以及特别的第五个分类--震荡变量. 
每个类别下都有两个数值 : 在左边的是所有永久修正的总和，而在右边的数值每回合计算一次.
震荡变量只有一个数值，它代表了那些会持续数个回合的修正效果. 大部分时候这个数值应该为0.

所有这些数值都会加起来，然后给出总的稳定度或者简单的显示稳定 (这个数值你可以在屏幕左上方看见). 而且这是唯一的一个会最终影响到你稳定状态的数值.

[BOLD]这里有两种方式计算稳定度[\BOLD]
这里有两种计算稳定度的方式：基于事件和基于国家.
你可以这么理解，你所拥有的会决定国家修正 (比如说你的总城市数目) 而基于事件的修正则是由你怎么获得 (比如说：你自己建立了一座城市或者说你占领了一坐城市e).

[BOLD]基于国家的修正[\BOLD]
国家修正会不定时的更新一次. 这通常会每回合或者每三回合或者当你的国家发生了很明显的变化 (例如建立了一座新的城市，系统便会开始重新计算或者检测). 因为它只看国家当前的状况，所以它一般会重新从0开始计算.之前的数值并不需要被记住. 这意味着一个错误出现时，这个错误不会被计算多于数回合，也因此它造成的影响是有限的(译者：错误原文是an error occur 我想不到有更好的翻译 所以只译成错误这个简单 但略奇怪的词).
由于所有的效果只计算一次，所以基于国家修正带来的影响很难被追踪 The effects of state-based modifiers are hard to track because all effects are calculated at once.

[BOLD]基于事件的修正[\BOLD]
在另一方面来说基于事件的修正每次都不会从0开始计算，因此这些修正每次都会被记住. 这会为每个分类存储一个单独的数字.因此它会记住到目前为止发生过的所有修正之和. 这意味着那些修正是永久性的且可累计的.这也意味着错误也会被累计. 同时由于只有一个数值会被记住，所以你不可能说出特定事件出现的频率，也因此也不可能限制单一修正所带来的全部影响And because only a single number is stored it is impossible to say how often a certain event has occured and therefore it is impossible to limit the total effect of a single modifier.
基于事件的修正是很容易被发现的. 就像你建立和占领或者摧毁一座城市的时候，你可以在F2界面看到相应的数值发生变化.有时会同时引起多个事件(比如摧毁城市同时也会触发占领城市) Sometimes more then one event is triggered at once (eg. razing a city triggers also conquering a city)

[BOLD]一些有用的提示[\BOLD]
震荡变量只显示事件带来的修正，所以有时可能会显示了一个非常大的数目.
在另一方面这些数值会减半，所以它会很快回复到0.

请注意当你的某些省份转变为不稳定的状态(原文worse status)会出现一个比较大的永久的稳定度变化.
在大多数情况下,只有当新文明出现在你的领土或者附近时才会引起这种变化(第一个例子就是当阿拉伯出生在拜占庭附近时).

还有很多特别的事件和历史事件机制也同样会影响你的稳定度 Various special events and historic mechanisms can also effect your stability.
比如说宗教改革事件中：如果你选择坚守天主教，那么你将会失去皈依新教所带来的经济和科研奖励,但是反对宗教改革也可能会给你带来一些稳定度改变 but the counter-reformation might bring some stability to your realm.
或者当你完成其中一个UHV任务时，也可能会给你小幅度的稳定度奖励.
