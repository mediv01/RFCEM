If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense, tangled growth of vines, shrubs and small trees, called a jungle. There are two types of rainforest, tropical rainforest and temperate rainforest.</English>

Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Fallout is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear blast or a nuclear reaction conducted in an unshielded facility, so called because it "falls out" of the sky after the explosion and shock wave have passed. It commonly refers to the radioactive dust and ash created when a nuclear weapon explodes, but this dust can also be originated in a damaged nuclear plant. This radioactive dust, consisting of material either directly vaporized by a nuclear blast or charged by exposure, is a highly dangerous kind of radioactive contamination. It can lead to the contamination of aquifers or soil and devastate the affected ecosystems years after the initial exposure.</English>

    <English>[TAB]In low-lying terrain, where water is plentiful and the water table lies close to the surface, it is common for the land to be muddy and heavily overgrown with vegetation. This type of terrain can be known as a swamp, bog, fen, marsh, or wetlands.[PARAGRAPH:1]Human interaction with swamps is complex. Swampy ground is difficult and dangerous to move through, often riddled with quicksand and bodies of water that make land vehicles useless, movement on foot difficult, and even small boat traffic a challenge. It is usually unsafe to build on wet ground, as heavy buildings will simply sink into the mud, never to be seen again. Construction on such unstable terrain requires the use of piles sunk deep into the swamp, and even then is often uneconomical for use on a large scale. Wetlands also serve as breeding grounds for insects that can carry diseases such as malaria.[PARAGRAPH:1]For all these reasons, many civilizations have attempted to drain the wetlands around them of water, so that the land can be used for other purposes. This often causes environmental damage and can destroy the livelihood of the inhabitants.</English>
