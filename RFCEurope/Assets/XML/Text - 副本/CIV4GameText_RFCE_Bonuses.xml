    <English>[TAB]Salt has been one of the most valued commodities in the history of mankind - among other reasons, humans need a certain amount of salt in their diet to survive. Humans have been harvesting salt for thousands of years; the practice started in the dim recesses of history, long before any written records were made.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of salt's greatest properties is its ability to preserve food. Before the development of reliable refrigeration, one of the few known ways to keep food from becoming inedible was to apply salt, which delays or prevents microbial invasion. (Some kinds of foods can also by preserved by "smoking" them.) In addition to its preservative qualities, salt also simply makes food taste better.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of the earliest-discovered methods of harvesting salt was by evaporating seawater under the sun, a very tedious and expensive process, leading to high prices for this important good. It wouldn't be until the mid-nineteenth century - when salt mining was widely practiced across the world - that this commodity would become much less expensive, no longer "worth its weight in gold," as it was commonly described. </English>

    <English>[TAB]The potato (Solanum tuberosum) is a perennial plant of the Solanaceae, or nightshade, family, commonly grown for its starchy tuber. Potatoes are the world's most widely grown tuber crop, and the fourth largest crop in terms of fresh produce (after rice, wheat, and maize), but this ranking is inflated due to the high water content of fresh potatoes relative to that of other crops. The potato originated in South America, somewhere in present-day Peru. Potatoes are important to the culture of the Andes, where farmers grow many different varieties that have a remarkable diversity of colors and shapes. Potatoes spread to the rest of the world after European contact with the Americas in the late 1400s and early 1500s and have since become an important field crop.</English>

    <English>[TAB]The history of coffee begins in the 9th century. It is thought to have originated in the highlands of Ethiopia and spread to the rest of the world via Egypt and Europe. The word coffee is derived from the Arabic word Qah'wa, over Ottoman Turkish Kahve, which originally meant wine or other intoxicating liquors. Partly due to the Islamic prohibition on drinking alcohol, preparing and drinking coffee became an important social ritual. In the 15th century, Muslims introduced coffee in Persia, Egypt, northern Africa and Turkey, where the first cafeteria, Kiva Han, opened in 1475 in Constantinople. The stimulant effect of drinking coffee caused it to be forbidden among orthodox and conservative imams in Mecca in 1511 and in Cairo in 1532 by a theological court. In Egypt, coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee cherries were sacked. But the product's popularity, particularly among intellectuals, led to the reversal of this decision in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Selim I. From the Muslim world, coffee spread to Europe, where it became popular in the 17th century. Dutch traders were the first to start large scale import of coffee into Europe.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Sulfur is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol S and atomic number 16. It is an abundant, tasteless, odorless, multivalent non-metal. Sulfur, in its native form, is a yellow crystalline solid. In nature, it can be found as the pure element or as sulfide and sulfate minerals. It is an essential element for life and is found in two amino acids. Its commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers but it is also widely used in gunpowder, matches, insecticides and fungicides. Sulfur (Sanskrit, sulvari; Latin, sulpur) was known in ancient times, and is referred to in the Biblical Pentateuch (Genesis). The word itself probably is from the Arabic sufra meaning yellow, from the bright color of the naturally occurring form, although the Sanskrit name for sulfur, sulvari could also be interpreted as meaning "enemy of copper". English translations of the Bible commonly refer to sulfur as "brimstone", giving rise to the name of 'Fire and brimstone' sermons, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that awaits the nonbelieving and unrepented. It is from this part of the Bible that Hell is implied to "smell of sulfur", although as mentioned above sulfur is in fact odorless. The "smell of sulfur" usually refers to the odor of hydrogen sulfide, e.g. from rotten eggs. Burning sulfur produces sulfur dioxide, the smell associated with burnt matches. Homer mentioned "pest-averting sulfur" in the 8th century BC and in 424 BC, the tribe of Boeotia destroyed the walls of a city by burning a mixture of coal, sulfur, and tar under them. Sometime in the 12th century, the Chinese invented gun powder which is a mixture of potassium nitrate (KNO3), carbon, and sulfur. Early alchemists gave sulfur its own alchemical symbol which was a triangle at the top of a cross. In the late 1770s, Antoine Lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element and not a compound.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Cultivated barley (H. vulgare) is descended from wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum), which grows wild in the Middle East. Both forms are diploid (2n=14 chromosomes). As wild barley is interfertile with domesticated barley, the two forms are often treated as one species, divided into Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum (wild) and subsp. vulgare (domesticated). The main difference between the two forms is the brittle rachis of the former, which enables seed dispersal in the wild. The earliest finds of wild barley come from Epi-Paleolithic sites in the Levant, beginning in the Natufian. The earliest domesticated barley occurs at Aceramic Neolithic sites such as the (PPN B) layers of Tell Abu Hureyra in Syria. Barley was one of the first crops domesticated in the Near East, at the same time as einkorn and emmer wheat. Barley was, alongside emmer wheat, a staple cereal of ancient Egypt, where it was used to make bread and beer; together, these were a complete diet. The general name for barley is jt (hypothetically pronounced "eat"); öma (hypothetically pronounced "SHE-ma") refers to Upper Egyptian barley and is a symbol of Upper Egypt. The ritual significance of barley in ancient Greece possibly dates back to the earliest stages of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The preparatory kykeon or mixed drink of the initiates, prepared from barley and herbs, was referred to in the Homeric hymn to Demeter, who was also called "Barley-mother". Greek practice was to dry the barley groats and roast them before preparing the porridge, according to Pliny the Elder's Natural History (xviii.72). This produces malt that soon ferments and becomes slightly alcoholic. Tibetan barley has been the only major staple food in Tibet for centuries. Palaeoethnobotanists have found that barley has been grown in the Korean Peninsula since the Early Mumun Pottery Period (c. 1500-850 B.C.) along with other crops such as millet, wheat, and legumes.</English>

The walrus is the only living species in the Odobenidae family and Odobenus genus. It is subdivided into three subspecies: the Atlantic Walrus (O. rosmarus rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Walrus (O. rosmarus divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. rosmarus laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]The walrus is immediately recognized by its prominent tusks, whiskers and great bulk. Adult Pacific males can weigh up to 1,700 kilograms (3,700 lb) and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals. It resides primarily in shallow oceanic shelf habitat, spending a significant proportion of its life on sea ice in pursuit of its preferred diet of benthic bivalve mollusks. It is a relatively long-lived, social animal and is considered a keystone species in Arctic marine ecosystems.[PARAGRAPH:2]The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks and bone. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the walrus was the object of heavy commercial exploitation for blubber and ivory and its numbers declined rapidly. Its global population has since rebounded, though the Atlantic and Laptev populations remain fragmented and at historically depressed levels.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Amber is the name for fossil resin or tree sap that is appreciated for its colour. It is used for the manufacture of ornamental objects and jewellery. Although not mineralized, it is sometimes considered a gemstone. Most of the world's amber is in the range of 30-90 million years old. Semi-fossilized resin or sub-fossil amber is called copal. The presence of insects in amber was noticed by the Romans and led them to the (correct) theory that at some point, amber had to be in a liquid state to cover the bodies of insects. Hence they gave it the expressive name of suceinum or gum-stone, a name that is still in use today to describe succinic acid as well as succinite, a term given to a particular type of amber by James Dwight Dana (see below under Baltic Amber). The Greek name for amber was Electron and was connected to the Sun God, one of whose titles was Elector or the Awakener.</English>

    <English>[TAB]While the Iberian Kingdoms were busy exploring the New World's southern and western reaches, England, France, and the Netherlands began to prod the northern continent in the 16th and 17th centuries. The reasons for their explorations changed throughout the period. At first, nearly all of them were searching for the "Northwest Passage", a way around North America to the Pacific. After plenty of failures, mutinies, deaths, and lost money, the nations realized that their efforts were in vain, so they searched for other reasons to have a piece of the continent.[PARAGRAPH:2]England found that America was an ideal place to put prisoners, relocate the religiously suppressed, grow cash crops, and "rid England of its surplus population"- in other words, send people out of the crowded cities, send them to Virginia, and hope they die. France found Quebec and Louisiana to be a land full of potential converts to Christianity (to which success was limited) and plenty of beaver, the pelts of which were in high demand in the 17th Century. The Dutch found an opportunity to shove more money into their already bulging pockets, and established profitable trading posts in New York, including New York City itself, even then a leading commercial center. Timber from North America was also an important resource for these seafaring nations, as there were few forests in left Western Europe with big enough trees for ship masts.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the 19th Century, North America had new values that had yet to be exploited. The eastern US became a major industrial center, thanks to nearby coal mines and new canals. The middle section of the continent also found new valuable attributes: land to sell to settlers, cultivatable land to feed growing populations, and vast oil fields all the way from Texas to Canada and Alaska. Alaska, along with much of western North America, also had rich gold veins. Scattered all along the much west coast, these deposits sparked major gold rushes in the region several times in the century, in some cases establishing major population centers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, with most of its oil drawn, gold mined, and industrial power nearly gone, it would first seem that North America had lost all of its economic value to the world. However, due to its consumerism society, North America is still a huge market for mass-produced goods. Also, the headquarters of several major high-tech companies are located here, which- along with consumerism- keeps North America in the world's global economy.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Access to South America was a huge bonus to Spain and Portugal, the continent's main explorers. In fact, except its north eastern corner, the entire continent was taken by the two nations. This is due to the value of having South America often being more easily recognizable than in North America, and the pay off came much more sooner.[PARAGRAPH:2]The western part of the continent was taken by Spain, for despite the arid climate and high altitude, among the Andes mountain range (and the empire inside it) was an astonishing amount of gold and silver. In the town of Potos? vein of 50 percent pure silver was struck, and the mining here was so rich that the money it accumulated- despite vast amounts exported to China, lost from smuggling, and the general lack of law and order in town- completely covered Spain's military budget for over a century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Portuguese had a later start, but still managed to claim and incredible amount of territory, known as Brazil. The wealth could be found among gold and diamonds, but soon it was found that even more money could be made by cutting down swaths of rainforests, planting sugarcane, tobacco, and coffee, and having the plantations worked by slaves from the Portuguese colony of Angola. On top the Angolans there were also plenty of native people to enslave as well, and some of the slavers made it all the way from Buenos Aries to Potosi, around 1500 miles away, and became silver smugglers. By the 19th century, Portugal conquered nearly the entire eastern continent; a vast amount of territory that was quite profitable, considering more sugarcane was now grown by Portugal than by another New World colony, and the money from slave depots and silver smugglers in Aries and Paulo.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the modern day, South America has a very unstable political climate, with corruption, dictators, and juntas ever since the continent became independent. Sugarcane is still exported from Brazil, and Venezuela has oilfields, but unfortunately northwest South America- Columbia in particular- is now infamous for narcotics production. Still, there is hope for the continent, as tourism (due to Incan ruins and the Amazon rainforests, among others) is major boon to the economies of several counties, and Buenos Aries has since dropped its slave depots and now has a growing high-tech industry.</English>

    <English>[TAB]Access to East Asia was the original driving force of European exploration and colonization, but it was always on the minds of Western traders. The profit surrounding the trade - which included silk, spice, gold, and other valuable items - was immense, and has been coveted by the West ever since trade routes linked Orientals to Occidentals.[PARAGRAPH:2]European trade with China has gone at least as far back as the infancy of the Roman Empire, whom traded with the Chinese Han Empire via a vast transcontinental trade route known as the Silk Road. The trade remained a very lucrative business, even after the fall of Rome, and goods from the East still flowed to the West despite the Silk Road falling into disrepair. This made travel more dangerous (and more expensive), but it made the goods that reached Europe all the more valuable. Constantinople was one of the first to profit off this trade, after the collapse of the Roman Empire due to its position on the most direct land and sea routes between Europe and Asia. Even the Emperor Justinian got in the act, by having silkworms smuggled from China.[PARAGRAPH:2]The riches of the East, however, did not leave the thoughts of ambitious Europeans. Within a century, goods that were once transported across small seas on Italian galleys were replaced by Spanish and Portuguese caravels, carracks and galleons. The two kingdoms were racing to the Indies, the spice rich islands that had made the Egyptians so wealthy. Portugal headed west, as it had already been exploring the African coast and needed only to round the continent, which was accomplished by Bartolomeu Dias in 1488. Spain meanwhile, sent a Genovese navigator, named Christopher Columbus, to find the Indies- by sailing west. Setting off in August of 1492, three months later he landed in what he thought was Indonesia. Columbus' discovery shocked the Portuguese, who believed that their claims to the East had been stolen by the Spaniards, and a shouting match between the two Empires. The Pope finally put an end to their bickering with the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which split the world into two halves, with Portugal ruling the East and Spain ruling the west.[PARAGRAPH:2]Other European powers eventually searched for a path to the East as well. English, French, and Dutch explorers tried to find a "Northwest Passage" around North America and into the Pacific. Unsuccessful, they instead ousted the Portuguese from West Africa and now the Dutch established a colony on the very tip of South Africa, Cape Town, which became a frequented resupply post for Dutch (and later British) Ships on the way to India, China, and Indonesia. The French also tried to reach the East, indeed one of Napoleons' goals when invading Egypt in 1799 was finding a route to India, as traveling through the Red Sea was much faster than rounding Cape Town or Cape Horn, on the tip of South America. When the British, who more or less controlled both points, then took Egypt for themselves, they would exploit this by building the Suez Canal, and the United States did the same in Panama to unite its Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, access to the East remains vital for Western businesses. Access to East Asia is much easier to achieve today with airports, Trans oceanic canals and even simply through the internet, but such access is crucial in and increasingly global economy with China becoming the world's prime industrial center, and India and Singapore as the high tech industry's chief locations for expansion.</English>
